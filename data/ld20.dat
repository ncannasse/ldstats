You can scroll between the two available items using your scroll wheel. Note that in the first levels, both items are disabled (indicated by the black outline of the item). When the items are in short supply, a number is presented over the item, indicating the number of remaining items you can drop on the screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>When dead, press the left mouse key once to restart the level.

A sound card is highly recommended for high class \r<br/>white noise sound effects.\r<br/>You start this at your own risk. I take no responsibilities whatsoever if something happens to your PC.\r<br/>\r<br/>The given theme:\r<br/>----------------\r<br/>It's dangerous to go alone. Take this!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The Gameplay:\r<br/>-------------\r<br/>It's a rather unoriginal Zelda clone. Fetch items, battle monsters and find out how to use your new weapons.\r<br/>Once you have all you need head for the almost hidden exit (on the west side).\r<br/>\r<br/>Control by cursor keys, Z/Y to toggle weapons, control to use a weapon (once acquired).\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The Sourcecode:\r<br/>---------------\r<br/>The full sourcecode plus a VS 2008 solution is included, so you can basically change the game as much as you want to. \r<br/>If you do so then please be fair and \r<br/>\r<br/>A) keep mentioning where you found the sourcecode and include a link to my homepage and \r<br/>B) notify me if you intend to release a modified version.\r<br/>\r<br/>The code itself isn't very clean and includes some ugly hacks, but that's the sake of time schedules.\r<br/>\r<br/>Press Alt-Enter to toggle window/fullscreen mode\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The author:\r<br/>-----------\r<br/>\r<br/>Georg &quot;Endurion&quot; Rottensteiner\r<br/>\r<br/>You can download this game from the authors homepage http://www.georg-rottensteiner.de. \r<br/>On the homepage you find also a lot of other games for free.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you want to report bugs or have ideas for additions email me at georg@georg-rottensteiner.de\r<br/>\r<br/>Neat: Looks like you need to put http:// in front of the download link.

I spent way too long on the graphics, so unfortunately there is only one level and no sound at all. Plus the title is just weird.\r<br/>\r<br/>The plan was to have different cats, each granting different abilities or power-ups. In the end there is just one, and it stops the Deathbots from shooting you but also causes them to come and give you a deadly hug. You must either be good at dodging them, or put the cat down to draw the Deathbots away from the exit.\r<br/>\r<br/>Its pretty freaking easy, but I feel like I've laid the ground for some deeper gameplay mechanics that would make for a more challenging game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Eagle eyed players might note that I've been stylistically inspired by a game whose name rhymes with Sportal (even down to the exit signs on the floor!). I turned up the cuteness to 11 though.\r<br/>\r<br/>This was my first Ludum Dare compo entry. I hope you enjoy it.",

The temperatures on the mountain are dangerously cold, so you must take a little penguin with you. Its hug will provide the necessary warmth for you to embark on your never ending vertical voyage. If you get hit by falling icicles, the penguin will fall off your back and you must retrieve it if you hope to climb further.\r<br/>\r<br/>The platforms are randomly generated as you climb, and the icicle drop-rate increases as you get higher up the mountain. Controls can be found in-game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately I was again hopeless at making decent background music for the game. Hopefully the gameplay, art, and sound effects will suffice.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my third Ludum Dare competition.

It works fine on the latest version Firefox and Chrome, but the framerate is better in Firefox.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your task is to control the satellite to send power to the earth and the space craft leaving it. If you missfire then the deadly laser will produce deadly neurotoxins, which lower your maximum possible score.\r<br/>\r<br/>I used the PhiloGL framework to produce this after first trying three.js and finding it to be impossible to use more than one texture per shader. PhiloGL was not much better, there appears to be some bugs with its vec4.distTo method and I had to make numerous other small changes to support multiple shaders.\r<br/>\r<br/>All the animation/events are framelocked, so people with slower computers will find this game easier to play.\r<br/>\r<br/>Known issues -\r<br/>* The sound is sometimes a bit erratic. The HTML5 implementation for audio sometimes lags.\r<br/>* Sometimes Firefox will silently complain that the textures are corrupt and then carry on as if nothing has happened. I think this is something to do with the FF caching the texture images incorrectly.\r<br/>* It does not work in IE",

He's only got an eye for treasure, and will chase after it whenever he sees it.  You can swing yourself in any direction to try to hit enemies, and if you really need to go somewhere your hero doesn't, if you hold down the mouse button you'll drag him in whatever direction you're pointing.  This makes you go much slower though, so watch out.",

One gameplay element I figured out was interesting - was the shapeshifting item.  A paperclip is an item you can modify - and you toggle its shape with a.  The only usable shape in this game, however - is the fireball-throwing wand (you shoot with f).\r<br/>\r<br/>This game has quite a few bugs - but it's perfectly possible to finish - it could however use some more content in the dungeon.  But this is what I feel I had the time and capacity to do - my main excuse is that I've been fighting with my own basecode.  I'll definitely be better prepared for LD21.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game was developed on Linux, and is cross-compiled for Windows.",

You could encourage social connections to others - for the sake of not going alone - go with them. You could try to find your own way.\r<br/>\r<br/>Authors comments:\r<br/>First LD for me - and it was quite harsh. I had a lot of problems (especially with programming). Also I have to admit that i fell in love with that visual style.\r<br/>It's very very very short and not very well documented but I hope that you can enjoy it anyway.",

If you are familiar with the works of Scott Sigler (such as Infected) or perhaps World War Z, then you have an idea of what I was aiming for here.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please note, there is a ton of strong language, gore and violence in the narrative. The is commensurate with other fiction in the genre, but I do throw the f-bomb around quite a bit (just because I can).\r<br/>\r<br/>It is an audio only game. Basically it is a combination of an audio book and a 'choose your own adventure' book.\r<br/>\r<br/>I managed to shrink the swf to 7 megs and it is on Kongregate now. Thank god. Still seems to sound pretty good in 32 mono.\r<br/>\r<br/>You will listen to the story and occasionally be prompted to make decision that affect how the game progresses. There are multiple endings (even a happy one in there somewhere).\r<br/>\r<br/>When you need to make a decision, press either 1 or 2.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is written in flash 10 with flash punk.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please play this when you are relaxed and feeling like reading a book. It progresses slowly and will not give you the instant thrills of most games.\r<br/>\r<br/>",

Now that that's out of the way...\r<br/>I know, it's not exactly &quot;It's dangerous out there!&quot; material, but unfortunately the time constraints of Ludum Dare forced me to go light on that. Originally the game was meant to have 25 levels with a text-based cutscene between every five levels, propelling a narrative involving your journey to adulthood and your father guiding you along. Like I said, time constraints caught up and the narrative had to be cut :/ However, the game WAS designed to tell a story about how your father gave you the Eunaborb in order to survive in the universe! The theme WAS considered! :P\r<br/>\r<br/>Other cut features include two more songs (one for the menu, one for the level editor) and the ability to load custom levels straight from the main menu, without having to go into the level editor.\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, I'm quite proud of what I managed to accomplish, especially considering I missed almost the first 12 hours of development :) The game has a full level editor (from scratch). You can import/export map codes directly, and you have three save slots in-game for your favorite maps!\r<br/>\r<br/>2 KNOWN GLITCHES:\r<br/> - After playing a level from within the PLAY GAME menu, player cannot return to root menu. Refresh the game to do so.\r<br/> - The mute button just doesn't work. Sorry :P\r<br/>\r<br/>You can play the game online, download the source code .FLA, and also download the music (which includes the two music tracks that didn't make it in the final game). My internet is super slow right now, but once it's better I'll upload a .zip with ALL the external scripts and full source :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy!\r<br/>\r<br/>-Nick Yonge\r<br/>Founder, Director, Master Chief Super-Executive Officer of Extreme Justice, krangGAMES\r<br/>www.kranggames.com\r<br/>nick@kranggames.com\r<br/>",

Hope you enjoy! =]\r<br/>\r<br/>[edit] You must stay within the torch's light, even if you are not holding it. If you are in darkness, you will slowly go insane. Your meter will refill if you are in the light. Falling from high places will cause you to drop your torch. Monsters also make you drop your torch or take it from you.\r<br/>\r<br/>Bugs:\r<br/>-After you die, torch light in not always reset. Kill your self again to fix. \r<br/>-The world camera does not stop at level boundaries, hence grey areas outside the map.\r<br/>-Torch some times gets stuck in walls\r<br/>-Occasional physics hiccups.\r<br/>\r<br/>I will be doing a post-compo version that addresses these bugs as well as a soundtrack/music. =]\r<br/>\r<br/>-Alex",

It would be like that if you have Windows XP or lower im almost sure. If you get any other problems please tell*\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun! \r<br/>      AND I DID MAKE THE GRAPHICS FOR THIS USING ADOBE PHOTOSHOP 7.0\r<br/>\r<br/>Its too dangerous for you alone so you are given spikes and towers to destroy the evil people that are trying to invade the town.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you can not download the game for some reason please rate the game as you see from the youtube video. Thank you!\r<br/>\r<br/>*There is now an update for the non-combo!!!*",

Pressing the &quot;Random&quot; button will generate a new map. Right now the player can collect keys scattered about the map.\r<br/>\r<br/>I modeled the models in Google Sketchup. \r<br/>\r<br/>Update on 5/6:\r<br/>\r<br/>I posted the link to the source tonight. It can be built with the Flex SDK. I also added a button for toggling the lighting. I included a screenshot with the lighting off.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks for the feedback. I wrote this as a proof of concept.\r<br/>\r<br/>I first wrote this engine in JavaScript around four years ago. I started porting the engine to AS3 early last year. After porting it, I rewrote the hidden surface removal algorithms. The engine originally sorted the polygons with the Painter's algorithm.\r<br/>\r<br/>This engine is not GPU accelerated.\r<br/>\r<br/>The engine skips frames. It is not rendering every frame. While skipping frames increases the speed, the rendering can appear choppy.\r<br/>\r<br/>I decided to develop a game from this engine and stop working on it when I read about Molehill. \r<br/>\r<br/>Update on 5/7:\r<br/>\r<br/>I added a mechanic to the game. After collecting a key, the player can open a chest. Opening a chest removes a key from the inventory. \r<br/>\r<br/>",

You can use the items that you receive from the old men in your battles against more monsters.\r<br/>\r<br/>The items you can get are as follows (weakest to strongest):\r<br/>Rope\r<br/>Kitten\r<br/>Dagger\r<br/>Sword\r<br/>Vial of Acid\r<br/>and...Justin Beiber.

There are other pilots scattered around whom you must rescue.  At the start of the game you have no weapons, you must rescue your fellow pilots as it is dangerous to go it alone.  Rescue all the pilots to win, get shot a bunch to lose.  Before you start the game you can customize some of the settings which can make the game very interesting.\r<br/>\r<br/>Cheats are included too (for debugging really, but they are fun sometimes so I included them): F1-F3 to get weapons\r<br/>\r<br/>Includes 3 original songs, about 1 minute each, they are not particularly good but you kind of ignore them once you start playing.\r<br/>\r<br/>You will need the .Net Framework 4.0 and XNA 4.0 Runtime, links below:\r<br/>\r<br/>.Net Framework 4.0: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992&amp;displaylang=en\r<br/>\r<br/>XNA 4.0 Runtime: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a88c6dec-aeae-42cd-a108-d35c013c3b97\r<br/>(the XNA runtime may include .Net 4.0, not sure)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit: Added a build using the XNA Reach profile for older graphics cards, should have only used this one but I forgot.",

Or you can descend into the dungeon.\r<br/>\r<br/>The dungeon is infinitely deep and there are infintely many side-by-side zones. Monsters do respawn but items and gold don't, so once you clear a level it's never worth coming back. Players have separate inventories and HP but have shared time and gold.\r<br/>\r<br/>I wish there was music and I wish the sound effects worked better. The game seems to go OK but it has very few frills. I'm kind of sad it ended up feeling a little like a Zelda 1 clone (since I like the Dungeon Relay angle). Didn't have time to implement more of the items/monsters I was excited about.\r<br/>\r<br/>Only source right now... I will try to port to py2exe and py2app when I have access to those platforms.",

This sometimes\r<br/>causes the game to not display anything if this doesn't match your\r<br/>desktop resolution (still don't know why, don't have time to figure \r<br/>out).\r<br/>Anyway, the easy way to go around is to either activate window mode, or\r<br/>to change the resolution to the desktop one.\r<br/>\r<br/>To do so, just edit the &quot;res.txt&quot; file...\r<br/>First line is the width, second line is the height.\r<br/>Third line is fullscreen mode: 0 turns it off (goes windowed), 1 turns\r<br/>it on.\r<br/>\r<br/>Game might also misbehave in screens that aren't 4:3 (don't have a setup\r<br/>here to test it at the moment)...\r<br/>\r<br/>Other than that, have fun!\r<br/>\r<br/>************************************************************\r<br/>\r<br/>Bug fixed version (not compo allowed, I think) fixes the following:\r<br/>- Initialization stuff on DirectX when desktop resolution is different than the fullscreen resolution\r<br/>- ESC no longer skips levels\r<br/>- Level 4 should be a bit easier\r<br/>- Lighting should be correct on all computers now\r<br/>\r<br/>Even if you evaluate the compo version, take a look at this one and feel free to commen! :)",

I even managed to record a tune for this game :D\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope You like it :)\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE:\r<br/>So it would seem that the game failed to run on certain systems. The solution is to install OpenAL.\r<br/>\r<br/>For Linux:\r<br/>Use Your package manager. Search for &quot;openal&quot; :)\r<br/>\r<br/>For Windows:\r<br/>http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip\r<br/>\r<br/>For Mac OS X:\r<br/>http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/OpenAL_Installer_OSX.dmg\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>A simple Manual is in the package. However I didn't manage to deliver all instructions/explanations. So here goes:\r<br/>\r<br/>- Tha game uses a point'n'click interface.\r<br/>- There are 3 NPCs in the game which will give You important items. The first one is at the first map.\r<br/>- NPC 1 gives You a sword.\r<br/>- NPC 2 gives You the ring of invisibility.\r<br/>- NPC 3 gives You the ring of regeneration.\r<br/>- Each map has from 1 to 3 exits. \r<br/>- The name on the current map can be seen in the top left corner of the screen when You enter it. MAP_NPC_x means that this map contains an NPC.\r<br/>- To take a screenshot press F12.\r<br/>- To show the console (for some reason :P) press ~.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've added to downloads an image with the level map for easier navigation.\r<br/>",

In short: More enemies, less flares, no paths from start to exit by just following the walls.  More updates soon.\r<br/>\r<br/>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/TBeck%20-%20LD%2020%20-%20Update.swf\r<br/>\r<br/>TLDR:\r<br/>  Arrow Keys - Move\r<br/>  Left Click - Place Flare (Aim w/ Mouse)\r<br/>  The closer you are to a monster, the faster the sonar beeps.  Shoot flares to kill/reveal enemies.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks for your feedback, I will start working on updates tomorrow and put a link to newer versions here (though obviously the official competition version will remain as-is).\r<br/>\r<br/>Description:\r<br/>\r<br/>The easiest way to describe my game is that it's Minesweeper, except you control an actual character and instead of visual clues where the 'mines' are, there are audio clues.  The character has a sonar device which beeps faster/high pitched the closer you get to an enemy.  Walk into a square adjacent to an enemy, and you're dead.  \r<br/>\r<br/>If you think you know where an enemy is, you can throw one of your limited supply of flares.  If the area the flare lights up overlaps with an enemy, it dies.  Also, enemies won't attack you on lit-up tiles, even if it's within their range.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your goal is to make it through a series of randomly generated caves to make it through to the other side.  As you progress into deeper caves, the monster count increases.  Eventually, the number of flares you get per level starts to decrease.  If you can make it through the final level, with 10 enemies and 0 flares, you win!\r<br/>\r<br/>If you die, your choices are to retry the same layout, try a different layout with the same parameters, or give up, leading to the game over screen (which you may as well check out at least once).  Additionally, there are two different difficulty modes.  The differences are described in-game.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools Used:\r<br/>\r<br/>Language: Flash/Actionscript 3\r<br/>IDE: FlashDevelop\r<br/>Game Library: Flixel\r<br/>Map Editor: DAME (Very sparingly, mostly randomized levels)\r<br/>Music: LSDj in Visual Boy Advance\r<br/>Sound Effects: Spear &amp; Audacity\r<br/>Art: GIMP 2",

			"htmlDesc": "You are about to embark upon a quest when an old man of your acquaintance offers to assist you. He will provide you with a collection of enchanted items with various powers that may prove useful on your journey.\r<br/>\r<br/>However, the old man proves rather more enthusiastic than might reasonably have been expected, and provides you with far more items than you can carry. Worse, should you drop an item, the enchantment will cause it to explode in a shower of flames, which will critically wound you if you are unfortunate enough to come into contact.\r<br/>\r<br/>You must try to catch the items on your head, or let them fall and avoid the flames. The items will form a pile which becomes ever more precarious as it grows taller.\r<br/>\r<br/>Use the left and right arrow keys to move your character in the corresponding direction. When possible, move slowly by tapping the keys, in order to avoid causing the pile to collapse.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note to judges: I added Mochi high scores after the deadline. Also, the high score code isn't included in the source release in order to avoid revealing Mochi keys. The version with high scores is otherwise completely identical, but if you aren't happy with that, play the 'no high scores' version instead, which is what I originally submitted.",

Too many animations make flash slow o.O.\r<br/>Also, in the beginning, after hearing the theme, I wanted to add a LOT more items :&lt; (if you take a look at the source, you'll see some). Bubblegum!

It was also my first time using Flixel. I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out. I implemented a number of different types of speed traps (the only ones missing in the demo are the down vertical and horizontal darts) and have more ideas. I was never able to find a satisfactory workflow for level building (DAME was closest) so the &quot;game&quot; is really my two screen workspace. The music was created in GarageBand. Graphics in Photoshop. My favorite part of the game is probably the checkpoint strips. &quot;Cross your heart and hope not to die.&quot;\r<br/>\r<br/>With more time I'd craft some levels that introduce each speed trap and slowly ramp up the difficulty.

Take sis!&quot;\r<br/>--------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>This is a short platformer written in Flash for the competition. I used (and modified) the same &quot;physics engine&quot; and tile library I used and modified for &quot;Disco? Very!&quot; and some other games. All the content is new and then some.\r<br/>\r<br/>The chief innovation here is that the game is controlled entirely with mouse motion (no buttons). It's fairly intuitive, although it may be realistically frustrating. :) The ending should be pretty easy to find. If you're hardcore enough to collect everything then there's a little bit extra.\r<br/>\r<br/>Features:\r<br/> - 4 original tunes, some with lyrics and everything! A new record!\r<br/> - 25 accessible rooms, some more interesting than others. :)\r<br/> - Biologically plausible seeking behavior!\r<br/> - Single-input gameplay! Go ahead and use an eye-tracker!\r<br/> - Surprise ending!\r<br/>\r<br/>I may polish up some of the jumps for a post-compo version, since some are fiddly. Hint: Line-of-sight matters and the cats have different behaviors.\r<br/>\r<br/>I recorded a timelapse, with picture-in-picture webcam. It's here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUphCeVHoWg",

			"htmlDesc": "Instructions in-game. There are several rules of the game that I think I neglected to mention in the instructions:\r<br/>- You can rearrange supplies in the middle of bombing, by pressing &quot;Unready&quot;. However, moving supplies like this will give them a temporary visibility increase, proportional to the distance moved. Spec Ops have no such movement penalty.\r<br/>- Rebel sentiment goes up on a hospital bombing only if you had supplies present in the hospital at the time. (This only applies to the first two cities, because after that you're forced to put some supplies in a hospital at all times.)\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used: AS3 with FlashPunk, sfxr, GXSCC, Paint.NET, Photoshop, and some public domain music/photographs. I never used FlashDevelop or worked with FlashPunk until this competition started, but I have to say that I like them both. Definitely an improvement over working with Macromedia Flash.\r<br/>\r<br/>Unlike LD19, where I was pretty much done after 24 hours, for this entry I was doing significant programming up until the last minutes. I guess part of it was because I was still learning FlashPunk, and part of it was because I was a little busy the weekend and had to take some breaks from LD. Overall, I didn't quite accomplish everything that I wanted to, but I think it turned out rather nicely.\r<br/>\r<br/>Halfway through, I began to have second thoughts about making this game, because it might look like I'm trivializing the Libyan civil war. This game is not intended as a joke or a mockery, but as a serious (albeit light) statement about violence, diplomacy, and power. I admit that it isn't exactly politically correct, and I sincerely apologize if anybody is offended by the subject matter or tone.",

Hope you enjoy.\r<br/>\r<br/>Some people have expressed difficulty in learning the controls ( my bad! Sorry! ) so I thought I'd quickly explain them here :\r<br/>\r<br/>On the main screen (image 2) you have two options, on the left, is your Orphan list, Use this to look at your current Orphan Roster, and to Buy new Orphans.  On the right, is your District Map.  Use this to select which district you would like to go to.\r<br/>\r<br/>Once in a district, use WASD to move your character around.  Your orphans will follow.\r<br/>\r<br/>To send your orphans off to steal, mouse over your avatar, then click and drag out the path you wish your orphans to follow.  Release the mouse to stop drawing the path.  Then, press and hold space to select the number of Orphans you wish to follow that particular path.  Release space to send the orphans on their way.\r<br/>\r<br/>At any time, you can flick your mousewheel to recall *all* orphans from every path.  They should stop what they are doing and head straight back to you.  This is pretty useful to avoid cops and the likes.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope that makes more sense!",

It's a reflex type of game that uses the keyboard and the mouse. It's about the old man in the cave that gives people things. I didn't have time to include levels or anything, but I'm happy with how it turned out, and making is was lots of fun.\r<br/>\r<br/>If Yoyogames stops hating me any time soon, I'm going to put up an Instant Play version at their website.

After taking control of a superior entity in the center of the galaxy, you must aim its guns and AVOID hitting anything. (quite the opposite of what most are used to) \r<br/>\r<br/>Im proud of myself for attempting something fairly unique; however, the lack of any knowledge about a game like this made it hard to fine tune and balance. \r<br/>\r<br/>I feel like I have a good idea here; just needs some work, tweaking, and balancing. \r<br/>============================================================\r<br/>How to play:\r<br/>\r<br/> -Click on the bosses weapons and use A and D to aim them. Avoid hitting a planet.\r<br/>\r<br/> -Click on planets and buy abilities with research points. You can points over time. This happens faster when the planets are unharmed.\r<br/>\r<br/>-Use abilities and micro the weapons to stay alive!\r<br/>\r<br/>Note: Make sure you click the ! boxes to read more important info!\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you guys give it a try, and see some potential =] Tell me what you think!",

In the final game, that was modified to some ghosts that follows him, do some movements as he does, but always stick to the player, to protect him.\r<br/>Take this ! That's what the protectors shout when they hit a monster, and here's all the theme in this game !\r<br/>\r<br/>How to play : \r<br/>1. use the arrows to move : up to go forward, left/right to change direction/view and down to turn backward.\r<br/>2. use the space bar to jump above the monsters (only to avoid them)\r<br/>\r<br/>Hit the monsters with your protectors, and do not be touched by the monsters directly !\r<br/>\r<br/>Made with Unity, cfxr and thanks to GarageBand for the music !",

Aside from a few key bricks, the world is randomly generated every time you play. Only a small area is available for this release because of some technical limitations. Time ran out just before I could implement sound, so it will be a fairly quiet journey. I hope that you enjoy it. Watch your step!\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit: A certain bug prevents you from entering the city, so touching it should be your goal. There were no assets up there anyway :). Also, I added a webplayer.\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit on 5/24/11: I've added a link to the post-compo version of the game, which fixes most of the major bugs which plagued my entry.",

The set up is, you have been given a device that allows you to clone yourself to help you over come danger.

I slightly hacked Flixel to allow smooth transition between clones, so if you recompile from source you won't see that happening.\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm going to put some work into a finished version outside of the competition, I think it'd be a shame not to.\r<br/>\r<br/>Will write up more later... need sleep now, it's very late here in the UK :)",

That was a nightmare.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's a game about stealing jewels from a garden maze full of zombies.\r<br/>\r<br/>all instructions can be found on the game's index page. \r<br/>\r<br/>**Please contact me if you get a message about the server being down!!!**\r<br/>\r<br/>This is a game designed for multiple players on 2 teams - It should run in any web browser that supports the HTML5 canvas element.... HOWEVER *USE CHROME* for best results as the networking will be smoother than any other browser.\r<br/>\r<br/>I don't quite know where to begin describing the process of developing this game. Suffice to say I did something more complicated (by the networking) than I should have. The shooring mechanics are buggy and the graphics are barely more than placeholders but it was a rush at end to get some actual game mechanics in.\r<br/>\r<br/>On the birght side, as an excercise in writing a multiplayer tcp server and client this was more successfull than I expected. Especially when leveraging web sockets in chrome. The speed is awesome considering it's HTML and people are used to this tech having a latency of a couple of seconds, nevermind 16ms!!.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you're looking for the theme, it's the idea that you should take some team-mates into the middle of the maze with you, since you can't fight off the zombies on your own when carrying a jewel.\r<br/>\r<br/>",
