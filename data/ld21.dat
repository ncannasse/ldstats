I spent a good chunk of time doing FlashPunk tutorials and things just to get my game going and it wasn't until Sunday where things really pulled together.\r<br/>2. Keep it simple. I over-scoped bigtime on my game here and had to hack together gameplay at the very end. There is so much I wanted to do, but just no time.\r<br/>3. Learn how to make music. I can do the art, coding, and effects just fine, but I am hopeless with music.

It's rare, but try and 'zone' at least half a tile away from collidables. Also, it sometimes goes funky if you change zones too much (primarily around 1-1 and 1-2). Sorry. :(",

			"htmlDesc": "An 8-level (+intro) puzzle/action game about a curse. The objective is to kill yourself - or rather, the body you're haunting. Experiment with things like dying from fall damage or getting squished by moving objects.\r<br/>\r<br/>Important: install the included font before playing. The game loves it so much, it seems to crash without it. Thanks to Joeyy from #ludumdare for helping me discover this. After that, start the game from /dist/curse.exe. The necessary few attributions can be found in readme.txt. And let's not forget bfxr for the sound effects.\r<br/>\r<br/>A &amp; D to move, W to jump (even when falling), S to flip switches. R to retry if you get stuck.\r<br/>\r<br/>-\r<br/>\r<br/>I initially submitted this game with several hours to go. Due to feedback, the update submitted on the extended time added a simple level 0.\r<br/>\r<br/>For people with small screens (such as laptop users): I've made an alternative version which runs in a 608x448 window. This in turn made some animations play back faster, so I also slowed them down to roughly the original speed. Otherwise the code is unchanged, it's merely a bugfix. Thanks to Wallacoloo for mentioning this. \r<br/>\r<br/>1.0d fixed a missing hard-coded event in the fifth level.",

Jerry the dairy farmer's retirement savings were destroyed, and he went into a profit-driven frenzy to recoup the loss.

Your goal: don't get milked!\r<br/>\r<br/>All this running from Farmer Jerry makes you tired, though, so you must make the occasional stop to eat grass, goatberries, and coffee beans, all while avoiding bottomless pits, mud holes, tumbling boulders, high winds, and burning hot magma.\r<br/>\r<br/>Goat Milk features six action-packed levels of Goatberry-munching glory.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Music generated at http://www.earslap.com/projectslab/otomata\r<br/>Sounds made by voice and sfxr.\r<br/>Created with Game Maker.

As I normally submit little games that I make in my own &quot;engine&quot; with very few tools to work with, I needed some form of middleware to handle assets.\r<br/>\r<br/>Initially, we went with Cryengine3, but currently, you can't log in with the same developer account and all level files are encrypted to the login.\r<br/>\r<br/>After learning that, we switched to Unity.  Neither of use had used Unity before so there was a lot of learning involved; I spent about equal time making this game as I did looking up documentation and going through tutorials.  Still, we managed to make a little game and hope to make a bigger one next time!\r<br/>\r<br/>Code/Script/Final Deployment/Crappy Particle Shower at End by Max Maroe (Drakfyre)\r<br/>Particles/Music/Sound/Game Design by Justin Moravetz\r<br/>Rain sound effect found here: http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=118514\r<br/>Special Thanks to MasterHyjinx for hosting TWO days of barbecue for the event!\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: Added ports to Windows and Mac; I have not tested the Windows port but will later; let me know if it gives anyone any trouble.

I am happy about succeding this challenge, i am learning a lot and this is an awesome community.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>A memory is about someone who is trapped metaphorically inside his head and cannot escape his past, it is some experimental idea i tried to print on this game.\r<br/>\r<br/>You have to explore &quot;your mind&quot; with the arrow keys looking for the 10 keys necessary to go through a portal that supposedly will take you out from there. Meanwhile, you can read the character&Atilde;&Acirc;&acute;s thoughts in the screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you like it,or at least feel something while playing through the game :)\r<br/>\r<br/>On development:\r<br/>I wrote the game in C++ using OpenGL, and a few helper libraries(FreeType &amp; ZLib for fonts, DevIL for PNGs)\r<br/>The images were done with GIMP, some of them are just edited photographs i took. I could not make it in time for the music because i did not manage to get OpenAL working on time for the submission.\r<br/>\r<br/>Again, hope you like it and i will be very pleased to answer any question about the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Cheers! \r<br/>\r<br/>Max",

			"htmlDesc": "This game is somewhat of an adaptation of Flatland, by Edwin A. Abbot, though that wasn't really my intention going in.\r<br/>\r<br/>My intention, instead, was to use the Facebook API and social network to create an asynchonous co-operative experience, where players worked together to complete the game and the story.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've done this to the extent that the game is quite possibly impossible to finish alone, and still very hard to finish when working with others (note: the social aspect is hidden at first, but becomes consequential once you get to the later levels, and hopefully will become apparent).\r<br/>\r<br/>This is pretty much an experiment, partly in story and partly in social media. I'd love to hear your takes on it.\r<br/>\r<br/>(please note that for the social aspect to work at all, it requires you and one of your facebook friends to play. It also only really kicks in after you're both at level 10. This is something that the game would ideally flag more, but I didn't get around to it...).\r<br/>\r<br/>More notes can be found on the webpage.\r<br/>\r<br/>(for those looking at the source - note that I took the php files off the source viewer as they were being executed rather than viewed for some reason. They'll still be in the zip, with database info stripped out, of course)\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE: Added commentary on youtube. \r<br/>MORE UPDATE: Postmortem!",

That idea evolved and eventually I ended up with this game. Basically you have 3 guys following you and you are running though corridors and rooms trying not to get hit. While making it there were several points where I wanted to quit because it just wasn't very fun, but I'm glad that I stuck it out and finished. There were a lot of things that I planned on adding (obvious by the inventory boxes on top that are never used), but not enough time. If I ever decide to do any more work on this you can find it at http://joedev.net\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls\r<br/>WASD or Arrows = Movement\r<br/>Space = Pause\r<br/>Left Click = Shoot",

This version will also have a timer running (with a leaderboard for those what complete it), and each death will add some amount of time.

In order to pickup/drop the blocks, you have to use the Shift key! This should make the game more user-friendly.\r<br/>Also, it is possible to use WASD for movement now, zooming works with Q and E.\r<br/>[/edit2]\r<br/>\r<br/>[edit]\r<br/>I uploaded the original LD version as SWF now, as the Kongregate version got an update. There was a bug (sometimes, when you clicked a button, there were two levels loaded) which I fixed, and I made the last level a tiny bit harder (deleted some blocks).\r<br/>[/edit]\r<br/>\r<br/>----------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>In this game, you have to allure bunnies into cages, by building a path with the arrowkeys and holding a carrot.\r<br/>Sounds easy? It is! But beware of the goblins and trolls!\r<br/>\r<br/>I had only less than 36 hours or so to make the game, and I learned a great portion of FlashPunk while doing it, so please be aware that there are some bugs. The biggest one is that the trolls somehow make invisible blocks ... :-/\r<br/>\r<br/>Other than that it is pretty playable, though I don't know if the last levels are beatable, or fun. ;-) [edit]I can confirm now that they are beatable.[/edit]\r<br/>\r<br/>----------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls: (for LD version)\r<br/>  Arrowkeys -&gt; Movement (+ Picking Blocks)\r<br/>  R -&gt; Restart Level\r<br/>  Q/W -&gt; Zoom (because it's fun)\r<br/>  1/2 -&gt; Switch Pick Mode (in Mode 2 you don't pick blocks anymore)\r<br/>\r<br/>----------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>BTW, the game's gameplay was inspired by great classics like BoulderDash and Spherical.\r<br/>\r<br/>...\r<br/>\r<br/>*cough* And Minecraft. *cough*",

			"htmlDesc": "My game is called &quot;Globular Prisonbreak&quot;. It's an action-puzzler about speed, precision, space, and color. A Blob creature, known as Bloopie, makes its escape from a Gnomish prison. There are 27 short levels in this frantic tetris-meets-frogger arcade.\r<br/>\r<br/>The idea is to dodge globular bullets coming at you from all sides as you make your way to the top of the level. If you are hit, the glob attach to Bloopie, becoming an extension of its body. So just don't get hit right? Not so simple... Blocking your path are laser force field gates which must be disarmed by sacrificing an exposed glob of matching color from Bloopie's body. Don't have the right color handy? Just absorb it from the bullets. But here's where it gets fun--the glob bullets are initially all grey. An absorbed glob adopts the color of the floor tile where it was absorbed! Pay heed to next color you'll need... and get the bullet in the right spot! Stay thin or get stuck and crushed in the stone gateway exit.\r<br/>\r<br/>What I used to make this game:\r<br/>A netbook.\r<br/>Flash Develop\r<br/>Flex compiler\r<br/>Flixel 2.55\r<br/>A desktop with crash-a-lot hardware (for music/graphics).\r<br/>Pxtone (ptVoice and ptCollage)\r<br/>\r<br/>Now a few notes on my first experience with Ludum Dare:\r<br/>I've been wanting to compete in ld48 or the jam for a few years now, but haven't had the time. I wasn't really prepared for this one either... I just stumbled here in the first several hours of competition and decided to join in. I'm so glad I did--it was a blast!\r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately my first game could not be polished as well as I would have liked before presenting it. There are some bugs, although the whole thing is quite playable and enjoyable throughout. I never did beat it in development, although I have just now for the first time while writing this... so you can except it to get quite challenging. Some honest advice: The game will tend to hide its bugs if you don't mash keys. Keen sight and a little hesitance will escape through the final 10 levels.\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm especially proud of the idea this game presents. I plan to improve on it in the future, starting with some fixes and features that didn't make the 7pm (PST) contest deadline.\r<br/>\r<br/>And last but not least.. I'm VERY MUCH looking forward to trying out YOUR games over the next few weeks!",

You've finally started to feel excitement in watching them try to achieve their dreams, only to have it dashed away when they explode in a fiery death.\r<br/>\r<br/>A new adventurer has come in, and his name is &quot;Jones.&quot; He appears to be very stupid, as he simply runs forward unless a wall appears in his way... or a rainbow. It's up to your rainbow-making powers to lead Jones safely out of the temple and onto an early retirement!\r<br/>\r<br/>- Draw walls with the mouse!\r<br/>- Lead a hapless adventurer to fortune and a death from old age!\r<br/>- Deflect arrows, block off lava pools, intercept crushing walls of death!\r<br/>- Watch somebody else collect treasure, treasure, treasure!\r<br/>- Help Jones run very, very, fast from a giant fiery death boulder!\r<br/>- Use your spirit powers to view the world in slow-motion so you can better defend Jones!",

			"htmlDesc": "This is my first ever Ludum Dare compo entry, and my first real game of its type using the Java language. \r<br/>You'll need Java installed to run it. \r<br/>\r<br/>It's a wave-based stationary survival game, with the goal to move through waves of enemies by shooting at them.\r<br/>Note: The story (detailed in game intro screens + death screen + win screens) is the important part of the theme integration.\r<br/>\r<br/>::-- You must survive 20 waves to escape the onslaught --::\r<br/>\r<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>IMPORTANT: \r<br/>\r<br/>I've seen the comments about the playability and bugs, so here's some warnings/tips before playing: \r<br/>\r<br/>1. Due to the way it's coded, bullets are only destroyed when they exit the screen or hit an enemy. Firing loads of bullets can lag the game. Fire in single or double bursts for best gameplay - as few bullets as possible at a time.\r<br/> \r<br/>2. Bullets have faster speeds when you fire with the cursor more towards the edge of the game field - to avoid the bullet clean-up problem mentioned in number (1), try to fire as far out as possible (again, in single or double bursts).\r<br/>\r<br/>3. Also due to the coding, only the most recent bullet fired will have collision. This can cause problems in clean-up (for example creating a bullet shield at slow speed means those bullets will not be cleaned up as they will not get to the edge of the screen or hit an enemy) and may confuse gameplay. For the best advice, I'd say that sticking to single or double shots will help in all cases (again). \r<br/>\r<br/>TL;DR:\r<br/>\r<br/>Fire as few bullets as possible, aiming as close to the edge of the screen (or the enemy you wish to kill) as possible, to get best performance and (hopefully) enjoyment. \r<br/>\r<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Please do feed back. It's a .jar file so feel free to download whichever &quot;platform&quot; you like. \r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you enjoy the game. \r<br/>\r<br/>- Jonno",

So, I'm not expecting high ratings (don't be too mean tho!) instead I just wanted to get something in so I could point to it and say, &quot;I did that!&quot;.\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE: Yes, I'm aware that I neglected to tell anyone what is supposed to happen in this game; I had meant to post an update with some fixes but day_job() has been running somewhat constantly. So here's a brief rundown on what is happening.\r<br/>The red dots are planets. Move along, nothing to see here, yet.\r<br/>The Blue dots are enemy fleets. Don't worry, they don't attack you right now..\r<br/>The green dot is your fleet. You can't see it, but there's 41 ships in there, and they all consume food, water and fuel each time you &quot;jump&quot;. You jump by clicking a spot in space that's within jump range of the fleet (yeah, I know, can't see it right?) and then hit end of turn.\r<br/>Woo, tonnes of fun right? Yeah, it's a prototype, not really a game, but I like the idea so PostCompo revs might have some interesting revisions.",

It has three different maze generation algorithms and the maze size is configurable.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've made Ascii Maze in C++ and libtcod for Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux.  I also wrote the game using Literate Programming as a methodology, so all the source code is described in the README file inside the package, in pain text and PDF formats.  The source code files inside the src folder are tangled from the plain text README document using a homegrown tool called atangle.\r<br/>\r<br/>I made Ascii Game simple on purpose since doing a any kind of literate program requires some time and in LD48 that's precisely what lacks the most.  Of course, this is all an excuse for my piss-poor imagination.  And not even a good one... ;_;",

My experiment for this LD was Procedural Music.\r<br/>\r<br/>To guide the music, you must avoid the red blobs, but attempt to collect the blue and green blobs. One will increase the chord complexity, and the other the progression complexity.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls are WASD to move, Esc will exit, and F1 will reset the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my second entry using my own engine, Psybrus. All engine code used is based on what was located at https://github.com/neilogd/Psybrus at the start of LD.\r<br/>\r<br/>All game code is written in GameMonkey (http://www.somedude.net/gamemonkey/). See the .gm files in &quot;Dist&quot; for all the game code. For some idiotic reason I decided to lump everything very hackly into &quot;game.gm&quot;. There you will find some horrific game code, along with the music generator. Hopefully I will get the time to clean this up, and improve upon it as there are so many avenues of music generation I wanted to explore, but didn't have the time to :(",

			"htmlDesc": "Alright, this is my first Ludum Dare entry and everything went smoothly.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is in XNA Reach, so any computer that has windows should be able to run it (at the very least it works on  3 year old netbooks). Just download the .zip and run the .exe You may need to extract it the contents of the .zip, though the .exe usually works straight out of the .zip. On older versions of windows you'll be asked to extract before running.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you encounter any kind of error, it's because you don't have one or both of the .Net 4.0 or XNA frameworks (must be installed in that order). If you've ever played an XNA game before, this one should work fine. \r<br/>\r<br/>.NET 4.0 web installer: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9CFB2D51-5FF4-4491-B0E5-B386F32C0992\r<br/>XNA 4.0 redist: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a88c6dec-aeae-42cd-a108-d35c013c3b97 \r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Followed is a story driven puzzle game about a man who is being followed. I like to think the story has some interesting undertones. The game is 12 levels long. Short of that, I can't really say too much.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's worth noting that absolutely anything coming out of your speakers while playing this game was done by myself on a cello.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used:\r<br/>C# XNA 4.0\r<br/>Paint.Net\r<br/>Logic Pro 9\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun!\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: Because of the high quantity of text files filed with random numbers, the .zip file trips the alert on some anti-virus system. For what it's worth, I assure you there is no virus.",

The controls are;\r<br/>\r<br/>Use the left and right arrow keys to move left and right. Press up to jump. If you have a gun press the space bar to use it. Press R to restart a level. Press H if you need help and help text will be added to the end of any text that is on screen. You can go forward or back a level using the &lt; and &gt; keys. If the game doesn't respond to key presses click on it to gain focus.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game seems to grow rather hard early on so if you have to use the help option or even skip a level don't feel too bad. Make sure to get through all the levels one way or another so you can see the ending screen though.\r<br/>\r<br/>Created in FlashDevelop with AS3. Bfxr was used for sounds.",

Using his new powers, the mouse decides to make an escape attempt.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Use the arrow keys (or A and D) to give the &quot;mouse&quot; (ball) some English - like tilting the table.  Try to grab the red security key-card and then touch the red door labelled &quot;authorized staff only&quot; to make a break for it!\r<br/>\r<br/>Programmed using HTML5 in javascript. Uses box2dweb and soundmanager2. Sound effects created by BSFXR. All art was drawn by hand using paper and markers, scanned and tinted in Photoshop.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game runs at 480x800 resolution because it is designed to work on smartphones.  It runs wonderfully on my Android HTC Desire Z phone, for example.  If you have a non-HD (low resolution) monitor it will be too big to fit.  For example, it definitely won't fit on older netbook screens which only have 600 pixels of height.  I hope to make a smaller version for the people who still have low def screens.  Might just produce a half-size version.\r<br/>\r<br/>Currently does not work in IE.  What a huge surprise.  Try Chrome, or pretty much anything other than IE.\r<br/>\r<br/>If anyone cares to test the game on their phone I'd be most grateful to hear whether it works.  Thanks!\r<br/>",

			"htmlDesc": "Fires &amp; Fights is a web-based (HTML / CSS / JS) two-player game about escaping a confined space. Player One controls the blue square (WASD to move, Q to open windows, E to put out fires) while Player Two controls the pink square (IJKL to move, U to open windows, O to put out fires). Work together, or you'll burn alone.\r<br/>\r<br/>Two players are required. Sorry if that's a hassle. This is my gift to those of you with significant others who were neglected over the last 48 hours, bring him/her in to play with you. In my own playtesting, I found that the close proximity required to play with two people on one keyboard results in greater than average amounts of snuggling. Enjoy.\r<br/>\r<br/>See the tutorial on the site for more specifics about gameplay. I wrote and tested the game using Chrome for OS X, and have tested it in Firefox as well, but besides those browsers...there be dragons.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've written up a post-mortem about how the game came to be and the inspirations behind it, which you can read here: http://samuelfine.com/firesandfights/dc.php. If you want to learn more, follow me on Twitter @54mf.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks for playing.",

I added a game over slightly past the hour but then I tested my game and had a last minute show stopping bug that I was too stupid to solve quickly at 4am. I hope that's OK usually LD is rather relaxed but if people get upset about that you can move me to the jam category.\r<br/>\r<br/>FOR TESTERS: One thing that can be misleading is that the arrow will point to the general prison area when you go pick up prisoners not individual prisoners, you have to look for them yourself. Sometimes they spawn in the shadows and are hard to see. Also no sound, sorry I barely managed to finish a game this time.\r<br/>\r<br/>Next time I'll try not to OCD over texture details, UV mapping and small misalignments in the meshes. I spent most of the weekend doing tedious adjustments that have little or no impact on the big picture v___v.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you like it!\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit: Made one last mini bug fix 1h30 after the compo, the restart after the game over had some leftovers. I figured I might as well fix it since I was already late and for the convenience of the testers so that they don't have to restart the game.",

However, they'll have to last pretty long if you're planning to get out.\r<br/>\r<br/>Luckily, you can revisit the past and master your challenges to perfection, granting you more room to spare in the present.\r<br/>\r<br/>This topdown action/agility game was made in less than 72 hours. Tested to work on Windows 7 and XP.",

I ended up doing something very different than anything I've done before.\r<br/>\r<br/>I went with the idea of psychological escape mechanisms, and avoiding difficult or painful thoughts.  The game (more of a playable story) has the player feeding the difficult thoughts to Anthony, a man tormented by painful memories.  The player must persist with the thought until Anthony accepts and comes to terms with it.\r<br/>\r<br/>I discovered that conveying a meaningful story through a first-person thought fragment narrative was very difficult.  I spent several hours developing a story, and ended up scrapping it and creating a much shorter, more workable one (that went in a very different direction) in the last couple hours.  The final result came together at the end.\r<br/>\r<br/>I created the game in the Flex 4 framework (with Flashdevelop) and Flashpunk.  The one piece of &quot;art&quot; was created in Photoshop, and the music in Reason.\r<br/>\r<br/>I kept the story pretty short, so it shouldn't take more than a couple minutes to play through it.",

Because of that you won't be able to get to a couple of the exits (the map sections switch around when the map is loaded, so you might not come across this problem).

This has been fantastic :D\r<br/>\r<br/>So you're kind of trapped in kind of a castle, and there are kind of ghosts everywhere, and you kind of need to escape their wrath and get out of the place. \r<br/>\r<br/>Also, some ambient sounds. Put headphones on :)\r<br/>\r<br/>A bug which makes the game to crash can sometimes be encountered after obtaining the second key, sorry..\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT 23/08 : I know the game is way too hard, but to challenge myself I've tried to beat it, moving slowly and hiding myself. And I did ! Just to see that I've failed my final trigger and the ending won't launch haha, owned..\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT 04/09 : An improved version of the game is now up on Kongregate. Remember to vote only according to the original &quot;Web&quot; version though :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Made with FlashPunk. I used a slightly modified version of the lighting engine by Noel Berry. \r<br/>\r<br/>",

(Clearly, I need to get better at using cxfreeze/py2exe.)\r<br/>\r<br/>Red Rover is an introspective game about a robot on a scientific mission. It is a puzzle game with more than one ending.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can choose to explore, carry out your mission, or simply contemplate the vast loneliness of being stranded on an alien planet.\r<br/>\r<br/>*** There may be more to the planet than meets the eye! :) Please explore a little bit before deciding to analyze every rock! ***\r<br/>\r<br/>Currently requires Python2.6+ and Pygame. I hope to have an app and an exe built if I can figure out the respective tools.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you are having trouble grabbing rocks, it helps to imagine the grabber claw in the exact center of the rover. So try to position yourself directly over the middle of the rocks (or where you want to drop the rocks). In retrospect I should have put the claw on the front (or back) to make it visible, but there just wasn't time.\r<br/>\r<br/>I have put some spoilers online here http://plastic-idolatry.com/ludum/redrover-spoiler.txt in case you find the puzzles hard or want to cut to the chase.",

			"htmlDesc": "Hi there. Far from my first LD but things did not go so smoothly. Had some other things to do these two days but still managed to sit some 20 hours behind computer.\r<br/>Sadly only something like 10 were productive.\r<br/>\r<br/>So, theme was too broad for my taste so I just started working on something I wanted to try for a while, to make a 2D Toribash like ragdoll toy. And I did. Had bunch of ideas how to make it in to an escape game afterwards. In the end went with zero gravity escape as with gravity its probably even more complex to control it then in Toribash lol :D\r<br/>\r<br/>Used Flash and Box2D . No time and motivation left to do graphics and sounds so pure code only ;/ But it has its own charm, will work more on graphics later :) \r<br/>\r<br/>&lt;Rant alert&gt;\r<br/> So it was my worst LD ever ;( Firstly got stuck with some angle calculations(well usual stuff) but then... \r<br/>- Then my mouse broke ;( \r<br/>- Then second mouse broke in same way which made me wonder if it is my notebook?!?! \r<br/>- So I was finishing it in frustration with broken mouse and a touch pad. Considering that mouse is main input method here it was horrible. \r<br/>- So those 10 hours of trying to figure out what happened with mouse and trying to achieve at least something with touchpad were hours reserved for sounds, graphics and normal level went in to ;/\r<br/>- Anyways it seems it is biggest LudumDare yet, so I was stuck trying to upload at 4Am until my own internet went down completely 0_o, just to add to problems and frustrations. So its actually good that submission was extended 12 hours because of site problems :)\r<br/>&lt;/Rand alert&gt;\r<br/>\r<br/>So, some strong speech and frustration for me here, but ah well, at least played with things I wanted :D Hope when frustration will goes away will experiment with this more. It should be a fun template for various types of games. \r<br/>\r<br/>Update:\r<br/>Added a video to YouTube with me passing this game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvdpZ4PiAO0 hope it will help people who never played Toribash to figure some things out, few advices:\r<br/>- Use space to pause the game and issue many commands at once\r<br/>- Remember about center of mass when you try to push\r<br/>- Relaxed parts absorb shocks, stiff ones bounce, so its a good idea to be relaxed when you don't want to bounce, or stiff all parts when you want to push with maximal force\r<br/>- And it is space, if you are flying in right direction just relax and wait, no need to go crazy and ruin your right direction :)\r<br/>",

Suddently: BINGO!\r<br/>\r<br/>The game features a story mode and a free run mode (with leaderboards).\r<br/>\r<br/>The story progresses through increasingly difficult levels as the player guides Urth to his uncertain future. As a genre Story mode is a combination of puzzle and abstract platforming.\r<br/>\r<br/>Escape mode features a large area populated by planets and stars, reflexes and timing are everything in this mode, as players try do distance themselves from the central star. As far as genres go escape mode is a cross between maze and reaction games. Players may also chose to add their scores to a leader board.\r<br/>\r<br/>Coding was done in processing, sounds with a mandolin and audacity. The leader board wasn't in the original plan, but I had spare time as the bulk of the code was done in day one, while day two brought more levels, artwork, menus and everything else.\r<br/>\r<br/>Contains many fast moving shapes, consider short pauses between levels if subject to vertigo!",

I had to cut pretty much all the non-placeholder graphics, animation, and sound for time, as well as the last level (which I thought to be the cleverest- maybe I'll expand on this idea later), but hopefully I got the idea across well enough.  In place of all that stuff is a bizarre ending that I kinda had to think up on the spot.\r<br/>\r<br/>I originally wanted a subtle, kinda artsy thing, but when I realized that I suck too much at art to do anything like that within the time constraints, I went in the complete opposite direction and abandoned all subtlety.  I tried to go for funny in a &quot;what the hell did I just play&quot; sort of way... though I didn't have the time to put much thought into that aspect.  Did I succeed at all?",

You should find Enrique Iglesias among the visitors and click on him. Then, people could escape from Enrique.\r<br/>\r<br/>But fail and people would listen to him. ",

If anybody has any problems or has any suggestions please post in the comments!\r<br/>\r<br/>Post Mortem:\r<br/>I had something like 9 story screens and 1 game screen planed and after building the game and 4 screens I got so bored of drawing.  \r<br/>Next time less art and more game.  \r<br/>I was only able to commit 14 hours and I was still able to make an alright game, supper happy with my scoping not getting out of hand as I am usually really bad with that.  \r<br/>I know the musket shot stuff doesn't really make sense, I should have taken it out and used more rocks and cannon balls.  \r<br/>I was planning on doing a couple more but different little games and could have fit 1 more in if i had not done as much art.\r<br/>The sound and the images don't sync up in the intro movie, I should have cut the audio into parts to match the images and then synked them individually.\r<br/>1440 x 900 was a good resolution to work in, except people with smaller resolutions cant play the game.  Next time I'm going to look at how to build a game that can expand to full screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>NextTime:\r<br/>Less art.\r<br/>Get a phsics engine before hand!

(Well, just empty tiles actually. I'll claim that as artistic liberty.)\r<br/>You get +10 points for each tile you convert, +100 for bonus tiles. The aim is to get through all the levels, converting as many tiles as you can to get the maximum points payoff!\r<br/>Controls are simple, arrow keys for movement and Z to use your pickaxe (breaks a gold block in the direction you're looking, but costs you 200 gold!).\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you like it, and please do make levels if you want to. It's very simple, just go into res/level/ and make a 32x24 PNG for the level layout, and a txt file with the same name as the image for the description that appears at the top! Finally add your level name (filename without the extension) to list.txt in the order you would like it to appear and enjoy!\r<br/>If you make any cool mods or whatever, do email them to me at BackwardSpy@gmail.com, I'd love to hear from you :)",

You have no guns that you can fire but you do get to help out the team by dropping turrets to help with killing enemies, and health packs to regenerate health. \r<br/>\r<br/>The more people you rescue and bring back to your base, the more money you get for equipment and upgrades.\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS:\r<br/>- Control Arrows for movement\r<br/>- Z for buying and picking up items\r<br/>\r<br/>SOME NOTES:\r<br/>- For this game I concentrated on the gameplay and less on graphics and sound.\r<br/>- Didn't have time to include an endgame. Basically just try to get the most number of kills and saves\r<br/>\r<br/>SOME TIPS:\r<br/>- Flinging really helps\r<br/>- Try to set up a camp with turrets, soldiers and medpack and see your score and money rise",

Your mission is to guide him through the everchanging network of duckboards, collect the Wisplings he needs to reactivate the Seal he came through and take one step closer to the home. To be honest though, the level are procedurally generated and the difficulty increases indefinitely, so the road is quite long. Maybe we need a sequel to relieve the Wisp from his torment?\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls are explained in-game, but we forgot a couple of details in the rush: You can skip to the opposite side of the maze by moving the Wisp outside the screen, providing that the block on the other side is accessible. Also if you stay still for a moment, the platforms directly under you will move. This is meant to prevent getting stuck so easily. The game can also be played with Xbox 360 controller if you have one hanging around.\r<br/>\r<br/>Spiritual was made by Team Jolly Roger for 21st Ludum Dare, using XNA Game Studio 4.0. Feel free to give us feedback or suggestions at teamjollyroger.com, or check us out on Facebook. We hope you enjoy the game!",

All you know is that you need to escape.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is a post-compo update that fixes some major bugs. Here's the list of changes from 1.00 to 1.03:\r<br/>\r<br/>-Added a few tiles to some rooms to make them slightly less dull.\r<br/>-Fixed a music bug with the red terminal (for real this time)\r<br/>-Added a secret 4th Boomka game you can unlock after beating the red terminal.\r<br/>-Added a &quot;portal&quot; object to a single room. It's related to the secret.\r<br/>-Made it so that checkpoints remember what key cards and doors are open when you save (as well as other variables, such as the music playing). This prevents you from grabbing a keycard, getting killed, but keeping the keycard after respawning.\r<br/>-Added sounds for the fireballs.\r<br/>-Randomized the fireball-pipe's first alarm a tiny bit.\r<br/>-Fireballs now destroy when they fall off the edge of the screen.\r<br/>-Made it so that using a terminal will reset the &quot;used&quot; status of checkpoints, so you can save again if you've just played a Boomka game.\r<br/>-Removed a couple of very frustrating spikes.\r<br/>-Moved around and added a couple of turrets, as well as some fireball-pipes.\r<br/>-Closed one of the exits early in the game, past a blue door. Turns out I never added a room past there. Silly me. :p\r<br/>-Refined the controls a bit. Feels a lot less slippery.\r<br/>-Added version number to the opening.\r<br/>-Fixed a few broken tiles\r<br/>-Added simple particle effects for sparks and blood.\r<br/>",

What you do know, is that you've been in captivity for as long as you can remember.  You're being held against your will, and you're referred to as SUBJECT:7 by your captors.\r<br/>\r<br/>How to play:\r<br/>\r<br/>Move with the arrow keys.  Other keys can be useful if stated in game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Goal:\r<br/>\r<br/>Find your way out.  This means sneaking past guards, decieving guards, and taking the hard route out.  Good luck.\r<br/>\r<br/>Technical Details:\r<br/>\r<br/>Written in C.  Uses SDL, OpenGL and OpenAL.  Graphics are made with GIMP.  Sound effects are made with SFXR.  The drumloops are made with Drumcircle (http://msm.runhello.com/?p=396).\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Written and best tested under Linux.  The Windows-version is known to work very well in wine.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hoping to get a Mac-version built soon.\r<br/>",

You collect one additional item to help you through your escape, of which you know nothing.\r<br/>\r<br/>Most of the game is spent jumping across platforms or hanging/strafing on ledges (you'll notice the movement is slower).\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls are WASD, and later, Mouse + Mouse Left and your choice of Mouse Right or Space. Remember the right click and space thing--they're a bit unintuitive, but I was in a hurry and couldn't think of a better way to resolve the dismount vs climb issue you'll run into.\r<br/>\r<br/>Easy on the eyes controls:\r<br/>W:       Jump / Climb ladders\r<br/>A/D:     Walk/strafe left/right\r<br/>S:       Descend, drop down\r<br/>Mouse:   Aim hook\r<br/>Mouse L: Launch hook\r<br/>Mouse R: Climb rope\r<br/>\r<br/>Made using the ENIGMA Development Environment. Source is in Game Maker GM6 format.\r<br/>\r<br/>Graphics made in GIMP by whoring the tree bark and walnut textures as well as the Wind distort filter.\r<br/>\r<br/>I offer binaries for Windows and for Ubuntu x86/x64. If you run neither, and still wish to play, you will have to compile it using ENIGMA, found here: http://enigma-dev.org/\r<br/>Sorry about that. I just don't have a Mac box.",

			"htmlDesc": "You are a ball of plasma trapped in an elemental maze. As you explore you can find different elemental modes to aid you in escaping unscathed from the numerous monsters out to get you.\r<br/>\r<br/>Keys:\r<br/>Arrow keys: movement\r<br/>Esc: Exit\r<br/>1 - raw mode (default mode. Gives you more health)\r<br/>2 - light mode (enemies notice you more, but after 5 seconds you get path finding to nearby objects of interest)\r<br/>3 - plant mode (slower movement but decreased damage from enemies and increased health regen)\r<br/>4 - lightning mode (take damage over time but damage nearby enemies)\r<br/>5 - water mode (enemies lose all friction and have worse control (doesn't work well, don't use))\r<br/>6 - shadow mode (enemies less likely to notice you, but you take more damage)\r<br/>7 - air mode (you move a lot faster, but are extremely vulnerable to damage)\r<br/>\r<br/>Tested in both linux and windows. You need python2.6 (or greater but not 3.0), pygame and python_openGL to run.\r<br/>\r<br/>Can download pygame installer for windows easily, but I found for pyOpenGL I had to download setuptools and run from the command line\r<br/>\r<br/>To run the game, just run the &quot;elemental_escape.py&quot; file.\r<br/>\r<br/>c:\\python26\\scripts\\easy_install.exe PyOpenGL PyOpenGL-accelerate\r<br/>\r<br/>Known issues: \r<br/>-Framerate is quite low (I think due to locking inefficiencies between movement and drawing threads)\r<br/>-Water mode allows monster to go very fast due to poor drag model.\r<br/>-Sometimes you (and monsters) can cut through the walls at their ends (not a big deal but not perfect)\r<br/>- breadth first search for path-finding (light mode) is inefficient. Maximum path-size is probably a good idea so the light-mode only checks for nearby items.\r<br/>\r<br/>ToDo:\r<br/>- Text to the screen for detailing keys to use, powers from the modes, that you've won the game, or lost the game, etc.\r<br/>- Better graphics (including animations), sound.\r<br/>- More than one kind of enemy, more interesting escape from them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tips on playing the game:\r<br/>- Monsters are less agile than you are. If you quickly dodge them effectively they can't find you.\r<br/>- You always start in the bottom-left of the maze, and the exit is always at the top-right of the maze.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also just a warning: I should've said this earlier so sorry to those who put the effort in and were disappointed. I did this game in very little time and I'm not really very experienced in game programming. The main problem is that I got it working and then didn't tweak it to be actually fun. So this game isn't really very good and I am aware of this. Only download if you're willing to try a not so good game and give it the rating it deserves.\r<br/>",

Hooray! Entering this competition was a great experience to have and let me actually know what it was like working under a deadline. I had to cut a lot of ideas and fancy things from the final product in order to make it a functioning game, but I'm happy how it turned out even though there isn't much to it. I will most likely enter when the next LD comes around and hopefully be more experienced so I can create something more complex.

			"htmlDesc": "UPDATE: I have added a PyExe version for Windows users\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my entry for LD21, called 'Terminal Escape'\r<br/>\r<br/>I have used Python and Pyglet, plus the A* implementation found at http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577519-a-star-shortest-path-algorithm/\r<br/>\r<br/>Synopsis:\r<br/>You are the computer hacker known as mr. Red. Mr. Green is caught while attempting to infiltrate a building and needs your help getting out by unlocking and locking the doors in the complex. Try to trap the red guard units into spare rooms, so mr. Green has a clean passage.\r<br/>\r<br/>Running the game:\r<br/>Windows users: use 'run.bat' to start the game (this will set the necessary environment variables)\r<br/>Linux and Mac OSX: You need Python 2.7 with the pyglet library to run this game. Execute 'python main.py' to start the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Your main control system is the terminal on the left of the screen. There you can enter commands to manipulate the systems on the network. Type 'help' at any time to find out the commands that are at your disposal. On the right is the blueprint of the current level. Mr. Green is indicated as a green dot. Enemy guard units are indicated with red.\r<br/>\r<br/>As soon as enough information is available, mr. Green will plot out his intended route to his destination. You can guide him by opening and closing doors.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tutorial:\r<br/>Enter the 'relays' command to discover all doors on the current level. The blueprint will show the door code names. Perform a 'scan' to get a hint which systems are on the network. You can 'connect' to each system using either its ip address or its canonical name. Doors can be 'locked' and 'unlocked', either allowing or preventing mr. Green to pass them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Known bugs:\r<br/>Sadly, some bugs make this game quite uninteresting. \r<br/>- The guards are really not that observant, so most of the time you can just run them over without them ever noticing you.\r<br/>- Another bug is in the third level, where the level switch event is not triggered.\r<br/>- Sometimes (observed in the second level), a guard will just run through a closed door.\r<br/>\r<br/>In-game story (not fleshed out in game, due to time constraints):\r<br/>You always knew something was off with this last job. Maybe it was the jittery behaviour of your contact or the fact that there was virtually no information available on the target. The pay was also substantially bigger than usual. Anyway, when mr. Green (a codename, of course) handed back the intel folder, you could not believe your ears when he told you he was in. Ordinarily, it was him that turned down potentially risky jobs. After all, it was his life on the line when the job went south. You were always safe, far away from the action. Well, if mr. Green wants to take the risk, you're game.\r<br/>\r<br/>The first door was easy. The guard units were milling around, not really paying any attention to the intruder. Then again, the scramble software always did its job properly.\r<br/>...\r<br/>Mr. Green: See? Nothing to it. Just an easy snatch and grab.\r<br/>Mr. Red: It still does not sit right with me. Have you any idea what this company does or what we are stealing?\r<br/>Mr. Green: No, I am only interested in remembering the building blueprints and the briefcase on LVL2.\r<br/>Mr. Red: Just be quick about it. I want to be out of here rather sooner than later.\r<br/>Mr. Green: Gee, what do your think ab...\r<br/>Announcer: Warning! Security has been breached! Warning! Deploying security drones.\r<br/>Mr. Green: What are you doing!?!\r<br/>Announcer: Security drones deployed. Please lie facedown on the ground with your arms on your head. The drones will shoot any attempt at fleeing.\r<br/>Mr. Green: You son-\r<br/>\r<br/>It happended before you could react. The room mr. Green just stept in suddenly disappeared from the system. No camera feeds, no door controls, nothing. You try to reconnect with mr. Green, but no luck. His signal is dead. Your scans of the network yield no results. For almost an hour the network was dark.\r<br/>\r<br/>An hour later, the system went back online, just as it was before the break in attempt. Shortly there after, mr. Greens signal came back.\r<br/>\r<br/>Mr. Green: Red, come in!\r<br/>Mr. Red: This is Red. Where are you?\r<br/>Mr. Green: On the third level of the complex. They have some weird cell complex here. I think I am the only one here, but the guard units are buzzing around frantically.\r<br/>Mr. Red: I am pulling up the schematics of the system. I am going to get you out. Hold tight!\r<br/>Mr. Green: Hurry, will ya? I do not want to find out why all these cells are here.",

Are you going to find all of them?\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT : Downloadable version added for Windows 32 &amp; 64 bit and several for Os/X  (I didn't know which one I should build with Unity so I built all the existent possibility )",

Running like mad usually ends up with the player getting exploded off the map.(Weeee!)\r<br/>\r<br/>The terrain is a bit over 16 square km. All of the artwork and sounds including the particle sprites were done by me this weekend. I didnt use a single premade unity item.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used:\r<br/>3d studio max\r<br/>photoshop\r<br/>unity\r<br/>geocontrol2\r<br/>notepad++\r<br/>\r<br/>I havent tested the mac version but if it doesen't work give the web version a try (it is an offline html.)\r<br/>\r<br/>Update: few hours left. Increased the &quot;Oh Sh!t&quot; factor a bit.\r<br/>Unity has a undocumented feature where it culls a bunch of stuff when you change the FOV of a camera. Zooming will lag a lot but it is still good to use if you are not getting shot at.",

Make good your escape while shooting down as many of the pesky blighters as you can.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls: Arrow keys to move, X to fire.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>I had other plans this weekend and so I didn't originally plan to enter Ludum Dare. However, I had ideas for the three top-rated themes, and I knew I'd be spending three hours on a train, during which time I might as well be making games, so I decided to have a go at making a game for Ludum Dare on an extra-short schedule.\r<br/>\r<br/>In the end I managed to spend about five hours on this game, but it wasn't really enough. It's a bullet hell game, but I didn't write code that's flexible enough to generate sufficiently interesting patterns. I had intended them to be fairly simple to fit the time constraint, but not this simple.\r<br/>\r<br/>Since I'm not convinced this sloppy pile of code has any real potential, I haven't bothered to write scoring code or code to detect collisions against the player. It just loops endlessly without any possibility to win or lose, although it's moderately satisfying to shoot the Thargoids for a while.\r<br/>\r<br/>For five hours I'm reasonably satisfied, but sorry it's no fun!",

You are set upon by all the issues that plauge your life, and must fix them without creating too many issues, or making any one issue too big.\r<br/>\r<br/>The issues you face scroll by in the background. As they become bigger issues, they become bigger, and if any one issue becomes too much, the game will end as you are overwhelmed. Likewise if you let everything build up, you will notice that the chance of espcaping hopelessness (visualised at the bottom of the screen) will fade.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you start to sort out your life, the issues will reduce in size, and your goal of escaping hopelessness will become clearer.\r<br/>\r<br/>It is intended that the game is very easy to loose, and juggling all of your issues is a hard task.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note there are a few issues with the bindings, and the static versions. The best bet is to run the source version, if you can handle installing the dependancies. The Linux precompiled version will probably only work on 64-bit systems, and the Windows one may give some errors in a command prompt, and may 'crash' when you exit - but the game itself will work.\r<br/>\r<br/>Overall, I'm happy I completed the task, and I hope the game is something a little bit different. I'm no artist, so the art and (lack of) animation is not great, and I feel I could have done better, but there we go.",

If you still get problems please say so in comments. Since I can only have 5 links I removed the HiDef download link of the old build.\r<br/>You can still download it here: Windows - HiDef http://www.mediafire.com/?hybb4pjxib9wpxs\r<br/>\r<br/>Dare To Escape is a bullet-hell platformer.\r<br/>\r<br/>You need XNA/.NET 4 to play the game.\r<br/>I am sorry for this! Never had to distribute an XNA game before. Thought they would work out of the box.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's my first time participating in LD and the first &quot;serious&quot; game I did by myself.\r<br/>\r<br/>Sadly there is not much content due to huge time problems.\r<br/>In exchange the difficulty curve is insane in the two levels it has.\r<br/>\r<br/>If the HiDef-version doesnt work for you, try out the Reach-version! If the Reach version doesn't work pls specify the error you get.\r<br/>\r<br/>I didn't include the uncompressed audio files in the source as they take 300mb of space. If you want to compile it you have to remove all occurences where the AudioManager or AudioHelper is used.\r<br/>\r<br/>The music was generated using http://tones.wolfram.com/generate/ . I hope this is allowed seeing how programs such as bfxr are allowed to generate sound effects.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is currently a bug in that bosses sometimes dont spawn if you play the game in one session. If you find a blue orb without there being a boss you should restart the game. You can use the resume feature afterwards to start at your last checkpoint and the boss should be there this time (if you didnt save after picking up the blue orb).\r<br/>\r<br/>I might expand upon this game in the future.

Works best with Chrome and Firefox.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>You have been captured while trying to find the plans of the Nazi reich. In order to escape from Castle Puzzlestein you will have to use your brains instead of your brawns. Unlike the guards in the more well-known caste, the gauards here are quite slow. They will move only when you move. They will however try to catch you if they get a glimse of you.\r<br/>\r<br/>Plan you actions ahead. At the far right of the screen is a palette with your available actions. Next to the palette is a container for your queue of actions. Either click these actions to add them to the queue or drag them in. The order of actions can also be rearranged. Remove actions by using the right mouse button.\r<br/>\r<br/>When you are satisified with your selection, you may start playback of the queue by using the playback buttons at the bottom. This will play each action in the queue in sequence. If a guard catches you, the playback will stop.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your ultimate goal is to reach the exit from each level. Good luck.\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE:\r<br/>I've added an updated version of the game, fixing some of the problems with the competition version. Please don't vote based on this version. These are some of the changes:\r<br/>\r<br/>* Added minimap\r<br/>* Grid on the floor\r<br/>* Rotate avatar towards enemy on collision\r<br/>* Change movement speed\r<br/>* No more horizontal scrolling in sequence list\r<br/>* Added an easier introduction level\r<br/>* Added loading bar\r<br/>",

The humans revolted and managed to explosively decompress themselves into space (wearing space suits). You were travelling so fast that they're spread out across several solar systems. Round up as many as you can. Don't let them escape.\r<br/>\r<br/>How to play:\r<br/>\r<br/>Click behind the ship to thrust it forward. You are pulled by the planets gravity. When all the humans in that system are collected, a portal to the next solar system will open. Fly into it to progress.\r<br/>\r<br/>Goal:\r<br/>\r<br/>Collect as many humans as possible. High scores game. High scores aren't saved to disk. You have 5 lives. Good Luck. \r<br/>\r<br/>Technical Details:\r<br/>\r<br/>Written in Python (www.python.org). Requires Pyglet (http://code.google.com/p/pyglet/). Graphics were created in Pixelmator. Sounds were created in as3sfxr. The logo font is Pirulin by Typodermic.

(I'm currently looking for a free/cheap/lightweight\r<br/>sound system that's suitable for little 2D PC projects...)\r<br/>\r<br/>Please don't rate this game if your computer is too slow to run it! It should\r<br/>run at 60fps on any reasonable gaming PC, but is unlikely to be playable on \r<br/>netbooks or laptops with weak GPUs. So I've included an LD48_LowSpec.exe that\r<br/>just turns off the bloom and mist layers, which might help some people.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>\r<br/>Arrow keys - Lean forwards/back\r<br/>Z          - Accelerate\r<br/>X          - Brake (yes, you'll need this)\r<br/>Space      - Restart level\r<br/>\r<br/>Goal: Get to safetly without killing yourself... \r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Levels\r<br/>\r<br/>They're procedurally generated, but with fixed seeds. They get harder, and will become impossible\r<br/>after a while...\r<br/>\r<br/>The first 15 levels are definitely doable, after that... maybe not :)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Base Code Used:\r<br/>\r<br/>The contents of code\\base is my 'standard base code'. I've used it for\r<br/>several Ludum Dare entries. It handles D3D/DInput setup, texture loading,\r<br/>maths (vector/matrix), fonts, and drawing polygons. It also contains the\r<br/>bloom effect.\r<br/>\r<br/>Feel free to copy+paste any useful bits you might find in there...\r<br/>\r<br/>All code in Code\\LD48 and textures in \\data were hacked together during the compo\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Main Tools Used:\r<br/>\r<br/>Visual Studio 2011, C++, DirectX9\r<br/>Chipmunk (2D Physics engine)\r<br/>Genetica (generating clouds + rock textures)\r<br/>Photoshop CS5 (Drawing the bike+biker)\r<br/>",

			"htmlDesc": "This is my first entry for Ludum Dare and I'm fairly happy with how it turned out.\r<br/>\r<br/>I wanted to focus on an escape attempt against impossible odds, which turned out pretty well. It's essentially a frantic game of attrition, getting quicker and quicker until The Runner ultimately dies. With any luck, you'll get more and more panicked as your Light starts to dwindle and more and more enemies start to spawn.\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls and instructions are in-game, but let me know if anything needs explaining.\r<br/>\r<br/>The graphical style ended up looking really cool in action, but there are a few things I would change if I did it again (most of them involving getting more sleep and ingesting less caffeine in some way).\r<br/>\r<br/>One major note that I forgot to put into the instructions is that powerups have a chance to drop from enemies when they die. Light+ boosts The Guide's Light radius (which has a hard limit) and Move+ permanently increases The Guide's movement speed.\r<br/>\r<br/>More than anything else in the game, I didn't like the fact that your ability to generate Light is based entirely on luck. I've toyed with the idea of being able to regenerate light by being near a lantern (and the people who playtested it mentioned it too), but I couldn't get it implemented in a way in which it doesn't break the balance of the game. \r<br/>\r<br/>Hints and Tips:\r<br/>- Don't pick up too many Speed+ powerups! More control is often needed.\r<br/>- Use the Lanterns to your advantage. Although they're not the best shield, they'll do in a pinch if you're low on Light.\r<br/>- Don't kill every Flyer you see. They always release a Red Bullet when they die. Sometimes you're better off leaving them.\r<br/>- When your COMBO hits 20/40/60/..., if you're not on full ammo for your right-click weapon, you'll get 1 ammo.\r<br/>- Only use your right-click weapon when it's essential. It resets your COMBO and significantly hinders your score.\r<br/>\r<br/>Let me know what you think of it and what score you get, my highest is 122460!\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used:\r<br/>Game Maker\r<br/>bfxr",

			"htmlDesc": "My game is about a rabbit trapped in a sort of castle full of wolves. I originally planned it to be more complex, with having the wolves chase you around, finding other rabbits and some other things. If it weren't for the 12-hour extension, this game would have a really small test room instead of a proper level and no sounds, so THANK YOU WEBSITE CRASH!\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is sort of a dungeon crawler. It should really have more levels, but it was hard enough to make a single one and I don't have any more time. You run through a maze, find things blocking your path, and find things to unblock your path. The game's biggest feature is the turn-based fighting system I managed to put together, which I think is pretty cool for a 48-hour game. It's also pretty fun. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: In response to the comments, the game did always feature a rabbit. I didn't really think about it, the only time it seemed weird was when I was making the bow-holding sprite, but even then it still seemed strangely natural.",

The game has 3 modes: Standard, where you simply type out a really silly story. The full text of what you have to type is displayed along the bottom. Along the top is your text entry box and the word you should type next. The second mode is called &quot;Nyan mode&quot; where you just type nyan over an over again until you become sick of it (or make 4 mistakes). The third mode is the one that most resembles an actual game, it's called Fish mode. Type the words that appear on the fish to destroy them, partly inspired by Typing of the Dead.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you have kids, it might be something they could play. Or you could use it to brush up on your typing skills. Or, I dunno, use it as a screensaver.",

The Overflow warning will change color as you get closer and closer to a buffer overflow.

If you escape Norm he'll burst before he even hits the buffer.\r<br/>- Chubbly, the rotund greeny. He's cheerful enough but if you don't escape him he'll take up three times as much space as Norm in the buffer.\r<br/>- Chomply, the toothy ill-tempered Chunk. Left unescaped he'll chew up all the data between him and the next Chomply Chunk. Best escape him posthaste.\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm really pleased with how this turned out. The first couple of hours this weekend were spent writing the clunky little JavaScript/canvas framework (view source on the game to see). Then I just started programming. With ugly colored rects. Just trying to get a grasp on the game logic and data structures. This morning I got up and designed the sprites and board. Then around noon I essentially rewrote the entire game to use the new assets. I'd love to do some 8-bit sound effects and chiptunes but I'm out of time (and HTML5 audio isn't there yet).",

Haven't been programming this effectively in a looooooong time, slept about 6 hours in this compo, and now I feel alive again! And still 4hours+ to go! THIS IS WHY I LOVE PROGRAMMING\r<br/>\r<br/>What I used:\r<br/>* Flash\r<br/>* flixel: easy to make fast platformers, and easy to understand too\r<br/>* GraphicsGale: Used it for the first time, and it's a lot better than what I did before: Photoshop and making my SpriteSheets on my own\r<br/>* cfxr and wolframtones for sound\r<br/>\r<br/>Was kinda hard though, because I couldn't debug for reasons unknown :P. My code didn't connect to the debugger somehow (so not even a trace()). Oh well...\r<br/>\r<br/>To the game: Didn't had a good idea from the start, so it became a platformer, which explained why I used flixel. \r<br/>\r<br/>----------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>----------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>You are an archeologist! Finding secrets and treasures is your job, your task, your fulfilling! One day, You find an ancient tomb mask. But can you just take it? It's being protected! Oh no! Escape the grasp of its protectors or you will never see the light again! And your soul will be trapped forever......\r<br/>\r<br/>KEYS:\r<br/>LEFT, RIGHT\r<br/>SPACE to jump\r<br/>X for interaction (just lift and throw actually)\r<br/>Also, you won't reach the next level if you don't have the gold with you. So you can't escape. In which case you'll die. Horribly. Slowly. Or fast when you hear that sound ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun everyone!",

			"htmlDesc": "This is my entry, it's called &quot;Dream Path&quot;. Go play! :)\r<br/>\r<br/>The concept of the game is that the protagonist is locked in her nightmares and needs to find a path out. Simple as that. It contains 16 puzzle levels, should take maybe 30 minutes to solve them all.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game looks quite bad in the screenshots, but I'm pretty happy how it looks &quot;live&quot; once it's animated. Also, the whole atmosphere I think is what went well this time.\r<br/>\r<br/>On the gameplay side itself, it turned out to be a really easy game, and I had a hard time building puzzles that aren't obvious. And I'm not at all happy with monster gameplay. It would be interesting to know if some better level designer could pull better levels out of the mechanics. So all in all, the gameplay side this time is a bit of a dissapointment. \r<br/>\r<br/>Overall I'm happy with what I came up with this time, considering I had such a hard time with it on the first day. Happily it all came together on the second day (altough the game is no where near what the original concept was).\r<br/>\r<br/>Programmed with Flash Develop, graphics drawn in Photoshop with Wacom and sounds done with Audacity + microphone + sample library.\r<br/>\r<br/>Source is a bit of a mess, but it's available if anyone cares.\r<br/>",

Without killing yourself.\r<br/>To detonate a bomb, you go to that square and press space to trigger the bomb - it will then fire when you leave the square.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are three sizes of bomb - the smallest will destroy the tile they're on and set off any bombs in the surrounding squares\r<br/>the medium size bomb will destroy adjacent squares as well, triggering any other bombs in a two-square radius.\r<br/>the large bomb will destroy an area of 3 square radius (triggering secondary explosions in any other bombs in the 4 square radius circle)\r<br/>\r<br/>Complicating matters, there are other types of tile\r<br/>&quot;Fragile&quot; tiles can only be stepped on once and will disintegrate when you leave them.\r<br/>&quot;Ice&quot; tiles, on which you cannot stop - if you enter a patch of ice tiles you'll skid all the way to the other end.\r<br/>&quot;slot&quot; tiles, which allow you to move the bombs to other adjacent slotted tiles. (To do this, press &quot;p&quot; to pick up or drop the bomb).\r<br/>\r<br/>Development\r<br/>-----------\r<br/>\r<br/>BombusaXX was developed in c++ with Visual studio Express 10. Though I reused some window-and-opengl setup code from other projects of mine, there was no framework involved beyond that.\r<br/>\r<br/>Graphics are done in the Gimp.\r<br/>\r<br/>Didn't get around to doing sound.. It was on the todo list but I ran out of time.",

So let's name it an &quot;avoid them all&quot; game. \r<br/>\r<br/>The more you avoid bullets, the more you score. Each bullet that goes out of the screen makes you earn 1 point. \r<br/>Your score fulfil a power gauge which allow you to active one of your 4 powers : \r<br/>\r<br/>1- Shield: glass shields block the bullets\r<br/>2- Nova: generate a nova circle around your ship and destroy all the bullets in it\r<br/>3- Mirror ball: makes the entire screen go BOOM and empty it\r<br/>4- Score x2: all bullets that go out of the screen make you earn 2 points !\r<br/>\r<br/>The idea behind the game is not just to &quot;escape&quot; the bullets. It is to &quot;escape&quot; reality. Firstly through the universe of the game and secondly because in the real world you will never just avoid the bullets without shooting.\r<br/>\r<br/>As you will see the game needs some improvements, balancing and lack from real musics and SFX. But don't worry ! This is just the first version. Updates will come soon :)\r<br/>\r<br/>We hope you'll like the game in this first release. Do not hesitate to drop a word, feedback, comments, anything will be appreciate. See you for another Jam :) \r<br/>\r<br/>Gameplay video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze7iF8JWjUs",

Of course, nothing's stopping you from grabbing some loot along the way - call it reparations, cash it in for your troubles. A non-linear goal of simply &quot;get outside the city&quot; and plenty of different ways to interact with the game world allow for all sorts of different solutions, not just one. For example, you can:\r<br/>\r<br/>-Drive a tank through a strip-mall\r<br/>-Assassinate a general and raid his military base\r<br/>-Rob a bank using mines\r<br/>\r<br/>And so forth and so on. Source is included in the zip, and I even put an .mp3 of the soundtrack in case someone finds it catchy.\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun!",

Didn't have time to put in &quot;restart key&quot; so if you get stuck you'll have to restart the app.\r<br/>\r<br/>Scratchy Get Out! is an arcade game where you &quot;Scratchy&quot; have to figure out how to escape from the room. I kind of molded it in after classic arcade games like Mario Bros.\r<br/>\r<br/>I should point out this is as much a puzzle game as it is an arcade game. It is pretty tricky but it is solvable. You will definitely have to use your brain to escape the room. You have to pick up items, operate machinery, etc to win.\r<br/>\r<br/>WARNING:\r<br/>The feedback coming in is that the game is way too hard. The level that I managed to build would normally be like the last level of a 20 level game. It has everything thrown in it and I made it as hard as possible. If I had had more time I could have made the tutorial levels necessary to make it not so frustrating for players. The one thing I really screwed up on was running out of time before I could build more levels. I had this wonderful toolbox ready and I could have easily built more levels (especially easier ones) if I had just had time. Oh well, I learned a lot with stencyl so next time my progress will be better.\r<br/>\r<br/>Due to people having so many issues with making progress, here is the walkthrough:\r<br/>\r<br/>SPOILER*******************\r<br/>Jump over the growlers and get a boulder. Climb the rope and jump on the cannon. The boulder should load into the cannon (if you aren't standing on top of the cannon). Then the cannon should fire the boulder into the crane. Drop the boulder on the blue rock by controlling the crane. the rock should break if you hit it. By the way, due to a bug, always wait at least 10 seconds after loading the crane before dropping a boulder. Ok, now you have a way to get back down and get more boulders. Keep doing so and reloading the cannon and try to kill off as many of the obstacles (knifers and growlers) that you think you need to to make it easy to get more boulders. Once you feel safe, start dropping the boulders on all of the things above the exit. Once you have cleared a path to the exit, then this time load a boulder but stay on top of the boulder. This might take a few tries (you have to be on the boulder just right). But then if done correctly the boulder should shoot you up into the crane and you will be stuck in it. Now move the crane over to where the exit is and release down. You have escaped!\r<br/>END SPOILER ***********************************\r<br/>\r<br/>Used stencyl to program and generate flash swf. Will post more details later. Posted on Kongregate.\r<br/>\r<br/>I am continuing to develop this game. Already I have a version that adds a cool indiana jones boulder dodging level and fixes some of the annoying bugs. Right now I'm providing the new version as an SWF. The best way to play is to download the SWF file and play in fullscreen mode. This is smoother and makes it seem more like an arcade game. You can download the SwF here:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5866491/Scratchy%20Get%20Out%21.swf\r<br/>\r<br/>There are two known bugs (that manage to make the game even harder, not easier of course):\r<br/>\r<br/>1. the &quot;getting high&quot; bug (if you get this you have to reload the game).\r<br/>\r<br/>2. the &quot;crumbling boulder&quot; bug (the workaround here is to wait 10 seconds after loading the crane with a boulder before releasing it).\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Here is a video walkthrough that might help you finish the game:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5866491/BeatScratchy/BeatScratchy.mp4\r<br/>\r<br/>",
