Collect points from trade routes between stars.\r<br/>\r<br/>Just remember: Closer to the center is always better! More resources, cheaper to colonize. Colonize from the center out.\r<br/>\r<br/>Moving from star to star takes 50 energy + the amount of distance between you and the next star. Just click on a star to move there. It takes a variable amount of years, based on your speed, your distance from the galactic core, and the distance to the next star.\r<br/>\r<br/>Exploring gives you a small chance to get an item, and takes 4 years, unless you've found sails.\r<br/>\r<br/>Colonizing takes a certain amount of energy. Colonies automatically grow as years go by. They also generate points both for themselves, and for trade routes.\r<br/>\r<br/>Diving into a sun is the primary way to get more energy. Each time you do, there will be less energy left. It also takes the same amount of time as exploring.\r<br/>\r<br/>Things you can find:\r<br/>Drives increase your world map movement speed.\r<br/>Capacitors increase your maximum energy.\r<br/>Sails reduce the time to explore or dive.\r<br/>Statues give you points.\r<br/>Crystals give you energy.",

I'll remember to upload the source code before judging is over. The source code for my pre-prepared library is already on my compo webpage. \r<br/>As for the models, they were done in Milkshape - took about 5 hours. I wasted a lot of time (1 hour) on UVW mapping because my texture map was laid out in a stupid way, but after that I just kept cloning the same blocks and re-arranging them into a unique silhouette for each subsequent ship so I didn't have to do any more mapping.\r<br/>The game actually contains models for 4 more alien ships, and textures for 2 space monsters (Space Crystal and Space Mushroom), which I didn't have time to implement.\r<br/>\r<br/>&gt;Hamumu\r<br/>Sorry, I'm not sure why it doesn't work for you.

The reason is simple. The enemies get you depending on their level. And a level of 1/2/3 and lifeforce of 2500 does not really show in the first levels, that's why. And that the shield is too strong (completely filling you up again) is also another thing. Yeah, it was harder before, and thinking that a lot of people would get frustrated with that, I turned the enemy strength down\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Hey there fellas, final version!\r<br/>Description:\r<br/>- Programmed with Gosu in Ruby! Simple, fast, fun, leaving more time for graphics and gizmos\r<br/>- Graphics in Photoshop. If you're wondering why the enemies are so generic, that's Wingdings :D\r<br/>\r<br/>To the game:\r<br/>- You are supposed to search through space for specific specimen. you can see which ones you are supposed to find on the right side of the screen (yellow would indicate that you found it already). killing them with your laser is sufficient :D. let's say the beam is a tracking beam, and they shrink or something. ^^\r<br/>- the game is supposed to give you a feeling of Touhou or something, but I created too many objects I guess and it got slow, so I took a lot of things out\r<br/>- forgot to add to the tutorial that you can also press down to retreat. that's because at that point I made the tut already, and well, was too tired to change it\r<br/>- even though I wanted to add sound, I left it out because the ones I made didn't gave me the right feeling I wanted to have for this game.\r<br/>- my left arm hurts. Actually, it feels empty (kinda) up to the fingertips. Need moar sleep\r<br/>- also made the enemies easier. their reach is a tiny bit smaller than yours :D\r<br/>- would have been great to add a huge endboss. but that wouldn't fit the theme anymore",

There's one\r<br/>ladder down on every floor, but the lower\r<br/>you are, the harder the monsters will be!\r<br/>\r<br/>The game continues until you die. Not\r<br/>very exciting I'm afraid.

The catch is that the goal point is in different place on every level, the environment is dark until explored, and there are red fields of death all around. If you get too far into the red, you'll die, but it's up to you to know how far is too far. So basically, my game consists of many big, dark mazes of danger. Infinite actually, they're procedurally generated, and you can choose the size of your board in game. Have fun!\r<br/>\r<br/>It's also worth noting that I only spent maybe 6 or 7 hours developing this, as I was a little limited on time this time around. I used C/C++, SDL and OpenGL to make the game, and GIMP for textures.\r<br/>\r<br/>",

You play as an unnamed character as you try to find your way out of your predicament from, well, being lost.\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls are simple. Use the arrow keys to move around and 'Z' to jump. To save, just climb on top of a yellow save pad and press down.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please, if you want the window to be bigger, just press F4. Don't strain your eyes. You need those.\r<br/>\r<br/>If the game crashes for anyone (as far as I know it has only happened once, this is no widespread problem), then tell me the circumstances so I can fix it as the rules say we can fix bugs preventing people from beating the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hint: For those of you trying to ascend the Flower Room (you will know what it is when you get there), make sure you save at the save point to the right (in the same room you started in) after you climb up. Or not, if you want to make the game much harder for yourself.\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit: I wasn't aware the source was required. I've included it now. In order to play properly, it needs all the data files included in the Windows download, so make sure you've downloaded that first.",

			"htmlDesc": "This is my first time with the Ludum Dare game compo, so I definitely made some rookie mistakes. I didn't get to implement everything I wanted to, but I ended up with a great foundation with a lot of potential, I think.\r<br/>\r<br/>Make sure you have some music playing in the background because I didn't have time to utilize ANY sound whatsoever.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's a 2-D platform / adventure game where the entire focus is on exploration and trying to figure out what's going on. You aren't really told what to do or how to do it, so you have to explore your surroundings.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's like Wall-E meets Fallout, crossed with Metroid minus the fighting. There are no enemies. Just you and the world. Your only real enemy is your constantly depleting battery. The game ends when you run out of juice or when you get to a certain door.\r<br/>\r<br/>I had a BLAST doing this!\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used\r<br/>----------\r<br/>\r<br/>Game Maker 7 Pro\r<br/>Adobe Photoshop CS4\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS\r<br/>--------\r<br/>\r<br/>Left / Right------------MOVE\r<br/>Up----------------------JUMP (with powerup)\r<br/>Down--------------------Search / Use\r<br/>Enter-------------------Open HUD display\r<br/>X-----------------------Close HUD display\r<br/>ESC---------------------Quit Game\r<br/>\r<br/>JUMPING: You cannot jump until you find the correct powerup. Jumping works differently in this game than most. Because you control a robot and your jump is controlled by a simple hydraulic rod, you have to be moving in order to jump at an angle and you cannot adjust while in midair. Jumping will drain your battery quickly, so be careful.\r<br/>\r<br/>HUD/Battery: Be sure to check your HUD (Enter) often to keep track of your battery power. There are two bars on the HUD. The top bar is your battery power. When your battery power gets low, an icon will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen. If your battery power reaches 0, it's game over, so use those charge stations!\r<br/>\r<br/>----------------------\r<br/>EDIT - 12/14/2009 2:10 AM\r<br/>I fixed a few bugs (I hope) that prevented the game from running correctly on certain machines. Details are in the ReadMe file included with the Windows download. I cannot port this to MAC, unfortunately. Sorry.",

			"htmlDesc": "Worker bees love to please their queen, and nothing pleases a queen more that gathering pollen to make honey.  This queen, however, is quite picky about her honey. As a result, she demands nothing less than perfection from her workers...and absolute obedience.  Gather pollen from the flowers that the queen indicates - in exactly the order she indicates - and all will be well.  If you forget the sequence, or mess it up, you'll have to start all over.  To receive orders or turn in pollen, use the arrow keys to enter the hive. The queen will tell you which sequence of flowers you must get. If you have completed a sequence, she will sing you a happy song. If you get the sequence wrong, she will scold you and you will have to start over.  If at any time you forget the sequence, you can enter the hive again to look at it, but if you have one wrong, then you'll start over.  Note: this is meant to be a memory game, so there is no help remembering where you are in the sequence once it is given to you. This is intentional.  Also you will find little yellow drops of honey on the ground which you can eat for bonus points. By the way you can win the game, but it might be difficult unless you cheat.  Oh yes, also don't fly past the fence as there is nothing out there. I toyed with the idea of making the bee not be able to go through the fence, but, hey - bees can fly!",

In 'Sail' mode, you get pushed around by the gravity of nearby planets in a pretty unpredictable manner. In Thrust, you don't and can manuever. You start in 'Sail' mode so you'll need to change to thrust to approach a planet. \r<br/>\r<br/>When you fly to the middle of a planet, the name of the planet will show up.

No content has been added, but the font size changed a bit.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is the first game I have ever completed.\r<br/>\r<br/>I wanted to break the normal &quot;exploration&quot; mold, where the goal is to uncover every single square on a map. The following elements were under focus:\r<br/>\r<br/>    * A conscious decision to depart from a comfortable space (leaving home)\r<br/>    * The one-way journey, leading your exploration far from the comfort zone\r<br/>    * Accepting the danger before you\r<br/>\r<br/>The actual &quot;exploration&quot; probably occurs after the end of the game. You will most likely have to play a few times before reaching all points on the field, this is by design.\r<br/>\r<br/>The entire game was built on Pygame. You will need Pygame installed and working to play.\r<br/>\r<br/>A very special thanks goes out to Wolfgang, without whom I might not have stuck with it to the end.",

Hopefully the Java4k will see a proper (fun) version of the game, with a couple of new elements to it.

However, the compressed version is significantly smaller than 4k, despite not being fully optimized.\r<br/>\r<br/>The linked source code also includes the source for the level editor I made for the game.",

Many times, if you only choose one of these such options once, you won't get the response that is necessary to proceed with the game.\r<br/>- Press tab to bring back up the last thing you entered as a command\r<br/>- Press escape at any time to exit the game\r<br/>- Many facets of the game are randomly determined. Play the game more than once; the story will be slightly different every time.\r<br/>- Call the servant at the beginning and talk to her some. I spent way too much time making her respond halfway intelligently.\r<br/>- I know ther's a slight gap when the music loops. It was unavoidable.",

So while I'm trying to conjure up this exe here is a step-by-step guide for the extremely impatient :) : \r<br/>1. installing python: get python 2.6.4(not 3.x!) from http://python.org\r<br/>2. Add the python directory to the PATH env in &quot;Control Panel&quot;-&gt;system-&gt;dont remember \r<br/>3.install pyOpenGL from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyOpenGL\r<br/>4. install pygame from http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml\r<br/>and you should be ready to go. still you need to use cmd to navigate to the game folder and do \r<br/>&quot;python main.py&quot;",

Yes, hot dogs. A resource more precious than gold...\r<br/>\r<br/>Once you have located the mother lode, you are to report back to base. When you have left the building, an escort team will take you the rest of the way.\r<br/>\r<br/>In the storage facility, there are numerous guard dogs. Big, mean, stupid guard dogs that will chase you down and kill you on sight. You can't outrun them, they're too fast. You can only keep them off your tail for so long.\r<br/>\r<br/>You're much, much more agile, though. You can dodge around quickly. If you're spotted, I'd advise you to put as many obstacles between you and the dog who saw you as you can, as quickly as you can.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can also sneak by them. While these dim-witted bullies can barely breathe without making noise, you are able to be completely silent. Well, until you start running, anyway.\r<br/>\r<br/>You only have so much stamina, so you'll need to rest now and then. You'll also need to eat hot dogs to keep your strength up. Don't worry, humans vastly underestimate the value of hot dogs, and have left them laying around, trusting that their precious guard dogs won't eat them.\r<br/>\r<br/>We don't know anything about the facility, other than the fact that the objective is somewhere within. We can only guess what kind of mad labyrinth the humans have built.\r<br/>\r<br/>Good luck, and be careful.",

			"htmlDesc": "My game is called Tree, and you have to explore what to do to it. :) I guess every game in existence fits the theme if you think about it.\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, my original idea was to make a the tree a &quot;tree of life&quot;/paradise kind of thing and have the explorer raze it (i.e. by anything you do, harms the tree and the less you ended up harming it, the better you did). It doesn't sound exactly fun, but that was the idea. Kind of like reversing the exploration theme. And it was supposed to be a bit more adveturish with supporting characters and dialog, but time didn't allow. (And my pixel art skills didn't either, that's why there's a &quot;robot&quot; as a character, not anything that would make sense.)\r<br/>\r<br/>The final version is not really super fun or anything, but I'm pretty happy with what I could achieve this time around. It could use much more work on the moving and digging etc., but what 48h game doesn't. If I had more time, I would've made the goals more clear and added lot more to do (achievements etc. too), now it's quite an empty/pointless place.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tech: Tried to go with flash+flixel, but soon it came apparent that you can really do just one time of a game with flixel, so this is all custom as3. The crappy graphics were done with Paint.Net, Flash CS4 and Corel Painter 11. Sounds sfxr, of course. I wish I could do music, it would've given the game a much better ambience.\r<br/>\r<br/>But anyway, that's it, try it out and leave comments. Thanks.",
