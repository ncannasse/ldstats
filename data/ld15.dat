			"htmlDesc": "FLYING TIPS:\r<br/>It seems the controls have received a lot of criticism. They are pretty tricky to get a handle on. Sorry for that! Improving them is just a matter of playing with gravity and the flap constants, but I unfortunately didn't have time :(\r<br/>\r<br/>However, it is still possible to play just fine! I hope these tips help.\r<br/>\r<br/>- If your keyboard keys do nothing it is because you have a gamepad or joystick connected. Use it or unplug it!\r<br/>- You can hold CTRL or Gamepad 1 to flap. No need to tap button.\r<br/>- You generate more lift when you aren't moving left or right. Just flap without a direction and you will fly upward. Very important for avoiding a crash!\r<br/>\r<br/>----------\r<br/>\r<br/>You are a fruit bat.\r<br/>You eat fruit.\r<br/>You live in a cave!\r<br/>\r<br/>Miners are in your cave.\r<br/>Destroying and taking.\r<br/>Stop them the only way you can...\r<br/>With GUANO!!!\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>- CTRL to flap\r<br/>- SPACE to excrete guano (poop)\r<br/>- ARROWs to navigate\r<br/>- If a gamepad is detected it will be used.\r<br/>\r<br/>Objective:\r<br/>- Rack up pooints by pooping on the miners\r<br/>- Clean miners and those returning with ore are worth the most!\r<br/>- Don't crash into the cave walls or miners\r<br/>- Try not to get hit by flying rocks\r<br/>\r<br/>------\r<br/>\r<br/>I had a great time taking part this year! This was my first time actually entering LD, and I will surely take part again next time!\r<br/>\r<br/>After LD ends I will port to MacOS X. It should just be a matter of getting compiler settings / include files right.\r<br/>For now its Win32 only.\r<br/>\r<br/>Looking forward to seeing what everyone else has produced!\r<br/>   - Jacob",

So for the game, you must escape the cavern. To escape, you must hop from Leprechaun land to the real world in order to escape the cave.\r<br/>\r<br/>Some have complained about unexplainable injuries on the left half of the level.

Yet, you can hold H key while you are away from enemies to regenerate; alternatively, you can edit nativedata.txt to balance the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>General edit: I edited this page with a new version of the game, partially allowing you to edit the game and fixing most of the bugs in the compo version. You can play it if you wish to play with some more content; but beware the potions; they can be really punishing or rewarding.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note edit: The game can be played in full screen mode if you press F4!\r<br/>#Controls:\r<br/>\r<br/>Arrow Keys\r<br/>\r<br/>I to see your Inventory/hide it\r<br/>\r<br/>Other keys will be told as you play\r<br/>\r<br/>#Information:\r<br/>\r<br/>Everyone knows that caverns lead to the center of the world. The fact is, not everyone wants to go to the center of the world. Actually, only the most eccentric people in the human society want to see the center of the world. But the way to the center of the world is full of dangers, traps, monsters from other universes, altars, pillars of magic, and, most importantly, as every adventurer should meet at least one, cursed shops of cursed shopkeepers.\r<br/>\r<br/>Play as the Gentleman Assassin, Modern Barbarian, Retired Commander or Redoubtable Dreamer in their quest to reach to the center of the world!\r<br/>\r<br/>Find and equip over 1700 items!\r<br/>\r<br/>Fight against many monsters and critters including murderous rats, bats, demons, vampires, and orcs (and the hideous A Bao A Qu!)!\r<br/>\r<br/>Listen to a great soundtrack which has only one song!\r<br/>\r<br/>Hear the sound effects generated using sfxr!\r<br/>\r<br/>Die tens of times before you understand what's going on!\r<br/>\r<br/>Witness the power of the procedural generation algorithm which generates caves that look like real caves!\r<br/>\r<br/>Play...\r<br/>\r<br/>ETERNAL SEEKER: CAVERNS OF DOOM!",

Those 4 brown boxes in the beginning are ladder kits, which you use to get away from the depths of the caves. Try to carry one with you at all times. throwing the ladder will cause it to appear downwards in front of you, and throwing it upwards will make it appear upwards right where you are. I hope you read this, because, well, it&acirc;s easy to get stuck without.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note that the ladder kit creates itself downwards if you don't aim it with the UP key. warning!! the falling blocks are slippery and buggy!\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm really happy with this one, especially when it took 11 hours.",

Also you cant move, instead you must throw stones at special bricks to activate their directed gravity field which will push you around.\r<br/>\r<br/>It is made with Panda3D and will therefore run from source on almost all platforms if Panda3D is installed. The game when compiled into an installer was 57mb for Windows which is too large to host on my website for everyone so you will just have to enjoy running this from source. This also means that you are able the create new levels because the level file format is just a python file which calls simple methods on the level object.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are only 3 levels because time was tight, but at least 2 out of the 3 will challenge you I hope.\r<br/>\r<br/>---About Panda3D---\r<br/>For those of you who avoid downloading extra engines just to run games I ask you: Have you not looked at this engine for use in your own games? It's so feature complete I must assume that you have simply never heard of it. EVERYONE I know who has looked into its capabilities has decided that there is no better engine to develop with. I hope you all enjoyed using what you did but more so I hope you will heed this advice that this is an engine worth using. This is my first 2D game using Panda3D, my others were an FPS and a Little Big Planet clone using Panda3D's builtin ODE Physics.",

Rate me based on this version, but if you want the newest version you can find it on my site (www.mattmakesgames.com).  Known bugs in the 48h version are (all fixed in the version on my site):\r<br/>-One obscure hard-to-reach exit in one room doesn't work properly.\r<br/>-If time runs out when you have your map open, the game crashes.\r<br/>-Some users get 'Unexpected Error' and crash on startup :(\r<br/>-Sometimes crashes if the corpse exits some rooms.\r<br/>\r<br/>TOOLS USED:\r<br/>\r<br/>-Game Maker 7.0\r<br/>-Audacity\r<br/>-SFXR\r<br/>\r<br/>COMPATIBILITY:\r<br/>\r<br/>- This game uses some video rendering capabilities that may not be compatible with various graphics cards. If \r<br/>the game does not show up properly, restarting your PC may solve the problem. \r<br/>\r<br/>- The game may crash if your screensaver comes on while playing, or you try to set your PC's resolution while the game is running.\r<br/>\r<br/>",

			"htmlDesc": "It's a side-scrolling shooter. Set in a cave. There's no story.\r<br/>\r<br/>Arrow keys move. X shoots.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game was programmed in Actionscript using the Flixel API and the free FlashDevelop IDE. The graphics were all painstakingly, maladroitly hand-pixeled in GraphicsGale. Sound effects courtesy of DrPetter's amazing sfxr, converted to mp3 using Audacity. The background track was made in Modplug tracker, using some 8-bit instruments.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are five basic entities: poorly-drawn gems, stalactites, stalagmites, ants, and bats. \r<br/>\r<br/>Collect gems for points.\r<br/>\r<br/>Stalactites can be shot down. If one falls on an ant or a bat, you get extra points. When it lands, the cavern shakes, and may dislodge other stalactites.\r<br/>\r<br/>Stalagmites are merely obstacles.\r<br/>\r<br/>Ants rest on the ground. They fire multiple non-homing shots in the air. As the game progresses, they fire more shots faster and with greater frequency. Ants can be killed with sustained fire.\r<br/>\r<br/>Bats rest on the ceiling. If you fire a shot while one is onscreen, it will swoop down and charge to the left side of the screen. Bats get faster as the game progresses, but still will never attack unless provoked. Bats can be killed, although it's usually better to avoid them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Score:\r<br/>Stalactite/Stalagmite: 1 pt.\r<br/>Ant/Bat: 50 pts.\r<br/>Gem: 100 pts.\r<br/>Crushing an enemy with a Stalactite: 250 pts.",

			"htmlDesc": "As mentioned in an earlier post I really wanted to create something with Ogre this weekend. Here's the end-result of a lot of learning and not so much gameplay coding!\r<br/>\r<br/>My original goal was to create a pong game inside a cavern, with deformed walls and rocks in the way, mixing things up. I didn't manage to get deformed walls, but at least there's a bunch of rocks to make it a bit different. I didn't of course settle for just any physics simulation, but picked PhysX because there seemed to be a good Ogre wrapper for it (NxOgre). Before this weekend I hadn't done anything with Ogre, PhysX or Blender, so it's been quite a productive learning experience, probably more suited for a MiniLD weekend though... I'm glad I managed to finish even what I have now, because 6 hours ago I only had a falling block on the screen. :)\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS:\r<br/>LCTRL+LSHIFT: Control the Left Paddle\r<br/>DOWN+UP: Control the Right Paddle\r<br/>SPACE: Reset\r<br/>ESC: Exit\r<br/>\r<br/>Requirements:\r<br/>I've tried to include all the dlls in the package, but you might have to install PhysX if you don't have an NVidia GPU.\r<br/>If nvcuda.dll is missing your PhysX driver might be a bit outdaetd, by googling I got the impression that old drivers didn't include CUDA.\r<br/>For those getting PhysXLoader.dll missing I found this thread http://www.dracula-origin.com/forum-en/viewtopic.php?p=2029 , dunno if it's worth it but you can go through the steps there if you already have PhysX installed. :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Libraries used:\r<br/>OGRE\r<br/>PhysX (NxOgre)\r<br/>OIS\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used:\r<br/>Visual Studio 2008\r<br/>Blender (+ some Ogre mesh exporters)\r<br/>\r<br/>The game probably includes many bugs and memory leaks I didn't manage to fix because of time constraints and not knowing what I was doing. :D",

If you get them all on one level press SPACE to generate another cavern. ESC to quit.\r<br/>\r<br/>Built using ZGameEditor (zgameeditor.org)\r<br/>\r<br/>To open the source in ZGE you may need the beta? not sure, try with the release ver. and let me know.\r<br/>\r<br/>Ok, here is a finished 'game',. well not so much, however it is a playable game-like and perhaps interesting to some.  The idea was to do a rogue-ish (as opposed to a proper Rogue-like) game inspired by DoomRL.  I was at the Hand Eye Society Social in Toronto on Thursday and chatting with Raigan Burns (metanetsoftware.com) who was gushing about how cool DoomRL is,. so I was just playing it when this LD15 came along,. I had also been thinking about doing something along these lines anyway (although a bit different) and had been doing some experiments with map generation in the ZGE latley, so seemed like a good idea, to just set it in a cavern.  The perlin-noise plus some levels of convolution works well to make nice cavernous maps,. so I use that here.  Next I wanted to have some lighting effects as well as a way to give the AIs limited vision.  So I did a brute-force raycasting lighting setup,. and most of the workflow slowdown came from figuring where to store what data and how to pass it between things,. as I normaly just stick with the model structure built into ZGE and in this case the 'map' is an array that is drawn from a single model.  Anyway hacknicalties slowed me down and I did not get much gameplay in here,. so I just hacked in some quick synth sounds and a couple visual tricks for shts and giggles,. and here you have my little entry.\r<br/>\r<br/>I did have a much more 'game' like idea, however time was just too short for that,.(or i was too slow?) but I do have something to show anyhow. I also learned a bunch of interesting stuff and will likely rebuild this whole thing and develop a proper game from the experiance gained,. so a successfull LD15 for me ;)   ",

			"htmlDesc": "My goal was to make a game using a language I had never tried, Processing, using no art or sound that wasn't procedurally created. Well, that was fun! Not! No, it was actually.\r<br/>\r<br/>I noticed a number of people were a little confused with how to play my entry Brinie, so I thought I would offer a quick guide to the game. It's funny, I just assumed everyone would pick it up through playing it a little bit.\r<br/>\r<br/>Ok, when the game starts, you should see Brinie, a net, and a bunch of things that look like fleas. These are the Grags. They live to eat, pretty much anything and everything. As Brinie is the only thing out there, you will see them start to chase her around. When they touch her, they begin feeding off of her. When they eat all they can, they will go off and cruise, but not before having a baby.  In this way, very quickly 10 Grags can become 100 Grags and 100 Grags can become 1000 Grags. If enough Grags get to Brinie, they will very quickly kill her off.\r<br/>\r<br/>You have three options to try to save Brinie.\r<br/>\r<br/>1) Drop a Gauloop somewhere on the playfield. It is a hive of small noisy creatures. These are like bait. They have a strong smell and may attract Grags away from Brinie. In the same way, Brinie doesn't like the smell of the Gauloop so it may repel her a bit. You can use these to try to get her to go where you want, or if not that, at least keep her away from certain places. The problem with Gauloops is that Grags feed off them and will quickly devour them and cause the ranks of Grags to grow greatly.\r<br/>\r<br/>2) Drop a Pauper somewhere on the playfield. A pauper is like a Gauloop, and it has a much stronger smell, but it doesn't feed them nearly as well. What it does do is after a few seconds, it explodes, killing all Grags in the area. If positioned properly, this can be used to wipe out a huge population of Grags. The drawback is that Grags love to eat dead Grags, and a few living Grags will find the carnage a great feasting area and may quickly multiple their ranks back up.\r<br/>\r<br/>3) Use your Net to capture Brinie. When Brinie is completely on the net, simply press the capture button and you win the game. The net also has the effect of killing any Grags on it at the time it is pressed. This fact can be used in combination with 1) and 2) to really wipe out the Grags. It is a great and difficult (and not necessary) accomplishment to completely wipe out the Grags, but it is possible and quite a fun challenge.\r<br/>\r<br/>Now you are limited to 9 Gauloops, 6 Paupers and 3 Net captures, so use them wisely. Also, you can only have up to 3 gauloops and 1 pauper on the playfield at one time, so that is a consideration as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>I used the language Processing for this entry. It was pretty much the first time I tried to use the language for anything. Got to say, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Don't recommend trying to learn a language and make a game in 48 hours though.\r<br/>\r<br/>All three versions (windows, mac os x, and linux) are compressed into Rar file. Source is included.\r<br/>\r<br/>Online applet is available here: http://www.brinie.org \r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks for Playing!",

I do appreciate all the comments.\r<br/>2. Oh boy, the installer. Unfortunately, it's the nature of the beast with XNA since it has a ton of dependencies.  You can skip those installs if you know you have a particular package, most likely everyone has everything but the XNA redists but I didnt want to take chances on a time sensitive project and wanted people to run it clean.  I did have a silent version for some other projects but it hung in some instances so I made it verbose.  I apologize to those that strongly prefer zip dumps.\r<br/>3.  Yes, my codebase requires SM2.0.  I'm not sure why it blocks some people for only one instance and then it allows it after, but that would explain any graphical glitches.\r<br/>4.  Yes Mediafire, so?  I host my files externally since my hosting is a hook up and I dont want to push my bandwidth limit.\r<br/>\r<br/>Unfinished but submitting this anyway, didnt blow a whole weekend for nothing :D Missing proper level, some art assets, and sound.\r<br/>\r<br/>Rescue your babies and bring them back to the roost.\r<br/>\r<br/>A - left\r<br/>D - right\r<br/>W - fly (keep tapping)\r<br/>Space - fire\r<br/>Return - roar to track whelps\r<br/>\r<br/>Esc - Quit\r<br/>",

This game is pretty much unfinished, but it has an ending.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game is an entry for the 48 Hour Game Development Competition #15 Ludum Dare (http://www.ludumdare.com).\r<br/>It requires Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP and DirectX 8. A sound card is highly recommended for high class \r<br/>white noise sound effects.\r<br/>You start this at your own risk. I take no responsibilities whatsoever if something happens to your PC.\r<br/>\r<br/>The given theme:\r<br/>----------------\r<br/>Caverns\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The Gameplay:\r<br/>-------------\r<br/>Infiltrate the enemy caverns and rescue your fellow agents. Wreak as much havok as possible.\r<br/>Move with cursor keys, aim with the mouse, press left button to shoot, right button to\r<br/>drop a grenade (once you picked up some).\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Afterthought:\r<br/>Since someone asked, there is no key card for the brown door. That's where I wanted to continue editing. \r<br/>You can press E inside the game to switch between play, edit tile and edit object mode (in case someone masochistic wants to figure out the weird editing system)",

I had wanted to have puzzles involving dropping rocks, such as building stairs, and activating switches, but I didn't have time in the end. If I get around to it, I'd like to do a nicer version, with proper levels, more stuff, and maybe a better random level as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>Oh, and a fix for the awful collision-checking with the ground. It is fail. :P\r<br/>\r<br/>----------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>You, archaeologist Ted Stuart (because archaeologists are always action heroes, for some reason) have wandered aimlessly into a cave that has laid undisturbed for millennia. Well, or so you think. It's actually been disturbed rather frequently by all the dinosaurs living down there.\r<br/>\r<br/>Living dinosaurs would make your job a waste of time, and so to preserve the livelihood of archaeologists everywhere, you seek to  destroy them all! However, your puny gun is no match for their unusually tough skin! Your only hope is that you can shoot down loose rocks from the ceiling to bonk the dinosaurs on the head with. Only then can you remain safely employed in these harsh economic times.\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS\r<br/>========\r<br/>A/D or Left/Right: Move\r<br/>W or Up: Jump\r<br/>Left mouse button: Fire bullets!\r<br/>\r<br/>Shoot down bits of cave to kill dinosaurs, without getting hit by either.\r<br/>You get points for distance and dino-killing. Your high score since opening the game is on the menu.\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy!\r<br/>\r<br/>~AtkinsSJ",

Is not bad game, but you know, 48 hours, is not much time. Is fine. I am okay.\r<br/>\r<br/>So, for those who did not look at updates (is okay, I am not mad, you are busy people), here is game; is game about boy who find fallen piece of sun in the snow. It get inside him and make him burn, and he melt right through the snow and fall into cave. In cave, he must find sunstones to keep himself lit. He is more powerful, the ice around him melts faster, which is useful but also dangerous.\r<br/>\r<br/>Game is simple right now. Level is randomly generated, jump around until find sunstone or die, repeat. Arrows or A/D for movement, up or W or space to jump. If you don't like level or level is impossible, press r or Enter to make new level. If you don't like sound or music (I SPIT ON YOU) then press m for mute.\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you will enjoy this game I have made. I spend many hours on it. Oh, yes, if you play the web version, I am telling you that it is 2 megs and takes time to load. Some people like preloaders. Some people like to have sex with animals, and that is all I will say about that, yes?\r<br/>\r<br/>edit: I am told that animations do not display in local play of download version. Is very bad, but easy fix. I am changing file system settings to local for this build, and now it is working. If you have downloaded candle.rar, please to download new version.",

Even thou they're mainly made with sfxr I tweaked each of them by hand.\r<br/>And I wanted the music to give a mellow misterious ambient, that doesn't bother to &quot;leave it on&quot;. I'm not a musician so I was not sure how it would work, but thanks to your comments I feel like it fits ok.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>I'll try to answer some of your comments:\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>* I've prepared a hint sheet.\r<br/>If you really want it, please email me through the Contact link on the top of the game's page.\r<br/>But I employ you to try for at least 10 minutes. Most of the people finally figures all out, just by spending a little bit more time.\r<br/>\r<br/>* There will be achievements in future versions: Finding X races, Making X races coexist, The generation you got to (cascaded mutations) etc.\r<br/>\r<br/>* I didn't understand well the lack of content comment. I did this game in about 10 hours because my girlfriend was home for the weekend. I have a lot more of ideas but I've freezed the game at v0.6 for the competition (you can check the latest post-LD48 version from a link on the game's page)\r<br/>\r<br/>* I couldn't see the differenc between a toy than a game.\r<br/>If it entretains you and makes you happy, you're still playing :)\r<br/>You can play it just to fullfill objectives (finding races) like regular games\r<br/>[i]or[/i]\r<br/>you can also design a nicer cavern, make colonies, withstand life for as long as you can, etc.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks again for taking some time with this game!\r<br/>-Martin\r<br/>\r<br/>2009/08/31\r<br/>\r<br/>Last update: I include a link to the SWF file for convenience (in case someone is doing a pack or something)\r<br/>http://www.tbam.com.ar/CavernsV06_LD48.zip\r<br/>\r<br/>--------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>2009/08/30 - v0.6\r<br/>\r<br/>Ok, I'll continue development on my own, but I've set up a link to &quot;keep it freezed&quot;\r<br/>\r<br/>You can check the latest updates at: http://www.tbam.com.ar/play--caverns.php\r<br/>\r<br/>Just in case, here's the official entry link (freezed at deadline hour 0): http://www.tbam.com.ar/play--caverns-ld48.php\r<br/>\r<br/>Good luck!\r<br/>-Martin\r<br/>\r<br/>2009/08/30 - v0.5\r<br/>\r<br/>Well this is the version 0.5\r<br/>Has music and some sound effects and a lot more of life.\r<br/>\r<br/>--------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>2009/08/29\r<br/>\r<br/>There is not much of a background, the idea struck me today around 10AM and what I've achieved so far is the thing I'm posting.\r<br/>\r<br/>I don't want to disclose any gameplay info or tips because it's meant to be experimented with.\r<br/>You can change the cavern with the mouse and the palette in the bottom in different ways... you'll start seeing some interesting stuff soon!\r<br/>\r<br/>It was made in AS3 using the Flixel library.\r<br/>I used Graphics Gale for the graphics.\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you enjoy it!\r<br/>-Martin\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>",

And you're not alone.\r<br/>\r<br/>------\r<br/>\r<br/>TO RUN:\r<br/>Worked out the problem I was having making an executable, now there is one, so just run it!  Not sure about compatibility, so good luck!\r<br/>Also, sound is very important, although quiet at times, so speakers or headphones should be used.\r<br/>\r<br/>-About-\r<br/>I wasn't actually intending to even participate in this Ludum Dare, but in mucking around with LOVE and lua for the first time I just kept tinkering and ended up with this.  Because of that it was very much made up as I went along, and it could have been much better if I knew what I was doing at the beginning. There's a few glitchy alignments, but I do rather like how the torch turned out (albeit horribly inefficiently done).  I'm also not sure how well (if at all) it'll run on other computers, was silly enough to only test it on my own.\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, it's pretty short and simple, randomly generated cave, you need to get out and you don't want to meet the other occupant.  Was going for a bit of a spooky running-from-unseen-horror sort of thing, and to that degree I feel it could have been much better with a unwinding story and specifically designed map.  Really this just turned into a sort of proof of concept (like so many LD entries seem to end up).  It worked out OK, though I've no idea if it's actually playable or fun after play/making it past being able to see the game anymore.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you want to try it I'd suggest the normal sized cave, I just put the larger option in because the code allowed for it.  The cavern tend to be pretty square, so normally  the best option is to head to a side and start going around it.  Or of course you can go looking for and avoiding the sounds (after a few plays through you'll know what noise to avoid).  \r<br/>\r<br/>Finally, if you're not able to find the exit no matter what, try pressing 'm'.  It's amazing how easy things are when you know where everything is!\r<br/>\r<br/>-OTHER STUFF-\r<br/>Coded in lua script using LOVE\r<br/>Notepad++ used for editing\r<br/>Made some sprites too\r<br/>Had fun\r<br/>Grabbed some sound from freesound.org, in particular from users starpause, HardPCM, and sagetyrtle\r<br/>The executable can actually be opened in an archiver to get to the source, but I up'd the straight source too",

Also, the windows build should now actually *work*.\r<br/>\r<br/>The idea was the to make a game in the style of Advance Wars or Final Fantasy Tactics, taking place underground, involving warring armies of mole people and, eventually, other underground nasties.\r<br/>\r<br/>The mouse-driven menu system is pretty terrible (as some of the comments below will attest). In fact, nearly every action in the game has a keyboard equivalent for the menu items. Unfortunately, key equivalent assignment is incredibly haphazard, since I ran out of time well before I got to going back and fixing them up. For the main action menu, it's the first letter of the action (M for Move, D for Dig, A for Attack). For choosing a destination square, you must use the mouse (only action in the game that requires the mouse). OK/Cancel is always enter and escape, respectively. Choosing a dig pattern can be done with the number keys (1 for the first pattern, 2 for the second). Choosing a dig direction is the arrow keys, or NWSE for North/south/east/west. Choosing an attack target is the arrow keys.\r<br/>\r<br/>I do intend to improve all that, when I continue to work on this in the future. But for the compo voting, unfortunately the controls are pretty terrible. Sorry for that.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note also that the source I have posted now is slightly different from what I had posted originally. I had actually posted the wrong source at the time, missing two hours of work that were done within the time limit but accidentally left out of the submission. If you're curious to see what the originally posted version looked like, you can check out http://bitbucket.org/philomory/ld15/get/ld46.zip\r<br/>\r<br/>running from source requires the gems 'require_all' and 'gosu'.",

			"htmlDesc": "Moons of Subterrane - LD15\r<br/>--------------------------\r<br/>Steven &quot;Stuckie&quot; Campbell\r<br/>\r<br/>**IMPORTANT NOTE**\r<br/>If it runs too fast on Windows, PLEASE make sure you're using the Fixed EXE, for the reasons explained below - I buggered up the submission somewhat, and you're using an OLD EXE.\r<br/>The easy way to test this is if there's any sound or not.. if there's no sound, you're using the WRONG version!\r<br/>\r<br/>Plot:\r<br/>We've been doing research around the Moons of Subterrane for a while now, though unfortunately the locals have decided they're not too happy about it anymore.\r<br/>\r<br/>They've unleashed a horde of vicious monsters into the caves we have been researching in.\r<br/>Your job is to clear these caves and rescue our researchers.\r<br/>Of course, the natives have also managed to destabalise each sector of the Moon we're in, so you've only got a set amount of time before it tears itself apart!\r<br/>\r<br/>You ship is controlled via the Arrow Keys.\r<br/>Z acts as a firing mechanism.\r<br/>X will transport researchers between your ship and whatever station you've landed on.\r<br/>\r<br/>Good Luck!\r<br/>\r<br/>-------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Oh the fun this was.\r<br/>I probably only spent about 24 hours on it max... wouldn't be too hard to extend either.\r<br/>\r<br/>Sounds were done in MilkyTracker via messing with the debug log as a sample source ;)\r<br/>Graphics in GIMP.\r<br/>Code in Lua mostly, with some engine tweaks in C/C++\r<br/>The engine does run on the Wiz and Dingoo, but I don't think I've got the buttons mapped, so it may run but not do anything.\r<br/>\r<br/>Full source code is provided though!\r<br/>\r<br/>I only managed to properly map out Chronos and the first two sectors of Kala.\r<br/>The rest are repeats of Chronos with random gravity values, and different tilemaps ( colour shifts, wooo )\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you enjoy it :)\r<br/>Built and tested on Windows 7 and Gentoo Linux AMD64\r<br/>\r<br/>--edit--\r<br/>Oops I forgot to mention two controls!\r<br/>Landing on a manned station will repair your ship.\r<br/>Holding down while doing this will speed up the repair - and your main station outside the caves will repair you much faster than the smaller ones inside.\r<br/>\r<br/>And to pause, press return.\r<br/>This is also used for restarting the game once the time runs out, and for ending the game at the end screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>-- Dingoo Notes --\r<br/>I had to do some more fiddling to get it to play on the Dingoo... as such, Player.lua was edited in the scripts, and some control stuff was messed with.\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Dpad - move\r<br/>B - Fire\r<br/>Y - Transport\r<br/>Start - Pause\r<br/>Select - Quit\r<br/>\r<br/>It's a fair bit slower too.. and no sound.. but, for an extra five mins work, better than nothing!\r<br/>\r<br/>-- GP2X-Wiz Notes --\r<br/>Controls are somewhat mangled due to the GP2X and Wiz sharing the strange &quot;diagonals are buttons too!&quot; philosophy..  however, it does run ( and faster than the dingoo! )\r<br/>\r<br/>DPAD - ship movement.\r<br/>X - Fire\r<br/>A - Transport\r<br/>MENU - Pause\r<br/>POWER-SWITCH - Quit ;) sorry... I forgot!\r<br/>\r<br/>A better controlled version will appear (much) later, but that's my quick ports down just now!\r<br/>\r<br/>Source changes for the ports are included, so you can see what was edited from the main entry.\r<br/>\r<br/>--Win32 Notes--\r<br/>In the main package above, I included an OLD exe ( has no sound, and no frame lock ) ... I uploaded a fixed exe which you should use. Amusingly, if you re-compiled off the source included in the zip, you'd get the correct exe ( which this is ) ... apologies for that! Lack of sleep and being ill really didn't help.\r<br/>\r<br/>-- Extra Help For Those Stuck At What To Do --\r<br/>The point of the game is to land on each station in the caves, and Transport the researchers from that point to your main base outside the cave.\r<br/>You do this by landing on the station, pressing down, and X on PC.\r<br/>You'll see your Researchers counter change from ( in the first level ) 0/0/5 to 0/1/4 indicating that you've rescued 0, have 1 in transit, with 4 remaining.\r<br/>Transport them to your base outside the caves, land, press down and X again, and your researchers status should change to 1/0/4 - showing you've rescued one, have 0 in transit with 4 remaining.\r<br/>If a station has no more researchers left, it dims ( and the landing pad's hazard lines go from yellow to red. )\r<br/>Each station you land at also restrengthens your shield if they're active ( you can speed this up by holding down ), and marks a respawn point, so should you die, you'll respawn there rather than on your base.\r<br/>You can also transport a researcher back to a station - main point of doing this is if you need to top up your shield after going too deep into the caves, and still too far from your main base.\r<br/>\r<br/>Once you rescue/kill ( if you die with a researcher in transit, they die too ) all researchers on that sector, you'll get a &quot;GET OFF THE MOON&quot; message, to which just fly outside the cave and straight up, or to the left. You'll then be taken to either the next sector of that moon, or the next moon if you've completed all 5 sectors.\r<br/>\r<br/>-- Survival Hints --\r<br/>Although killing everything in sight is good for points, some sectors are tight on time, and your main task is to save those researchers! Your best best is finding them all and moving them to a station near the exit first, and then blasting everything to bits.\r<br/>\r<br/>Be warned that if the timer comes under 75 units, the moon starts to destabalise, making it trickier to see what's going on as the timer ticks ever closer to zero.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope that helps those confused as to what's going on!\r<br/>\r<br/>-- Stuckie",
