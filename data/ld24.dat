Looking at it may ruin the fun of the discovery of all the ways for a cell to evolve, but will also make sure you found them all. Look at it if you want, it isn't an official part of the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>The post-compo version is slightly better. The changes are as follows:\r<br/>- implemented 'halo' around changing cells ( I had wanted to do this but ran out of time).\r<br/>- prevented an error that occasionally prevents one from getting past wave two of level one.\r<br/>- added support for skipping dialog with &lt;enter&gt;.\r<br/>- added support for visiting past dialog with &lt;backspace&gt;.\r<br/>- fixed some text errors in the dialog.\r<br/>- added 'fastforward' button that will remove the cap on fps and allow the simulation to run faster (if your computer sucks it won't run any faster).\r<br/>- fixed turrets spawning wrong (in the original code I accidently switched the data value for 'kind' with data value for 'wavespawn' making a basic turret that should spawn in wave two spawn as a machinegun turret in wave one).\r<br/>- added the identity of the mysterious static at the end of level five! It's pretty epic. Well, maybe not...\r<br/>\r<br/>Please don't look directly at the bugs!\r<br/>http://puu.sh/ZpuZ",

You find food.  When you eat enough food, you mutate.  Your mutation depends on the type of food you've been eating.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Some of the food is poisonous.  If you eat too much of it, you will die.  But try eating just a little, and see what happens.  Find the food that heals you to eat more poison safely.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:  Arrow keys L/R rotate, Up to move forward.\r<br/>\r<br/>The enhanced version fixes a few design issues and bugs, and as I continue to develop it will include some additional features that I never got to during the compo, such as color.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Read the enhancements post for details, updated whenever I upload more enhancements: \r<br/>\r<br/>http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/?p=177305\r<br/>\r<br/>Be sure to visit my website at http://csanyk.com and check out my other projects.

Defend yourself and the bioforge as you slowly change into something... different. Is this all just a dream?\r<br/>\r<br/>My original intent was to create a game similar to Spore's first stage, but it sort of just morphed into this. I think that in an abstract way, it still sticks to the theme - with gradual change over time, too small to notice any any instant, but noticeably there.\r<br/>\r<br/>Made possible by Slick2D, LWJGL, Wolfram Alpha, and sfxr.\r<br/>\r<br/>IMPORTANT:\r<br/>\r<br/>Install the latest JRE from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\r<br/>\r<br/>Then double click the file for your platform - game_windows, game_linux or game_mac (note: I don't have a Mac, so I don't know if that last one works - let me know!)\r<br/>\r<br/>If that doesn't work, try opening a terminal, cd into the entry directory, and run the jar with:\r<br/>\r<br/>java -Djava.library.path=native/&lt;platform&gt; -jar data.jar\r<br/>\r<br/>(for example: &quot;java -Djava.library.path=native/windows -jar data.jar)\r<br/>\r<br/>If you get an error about unsupported version - update your JRE from Oracle's website!\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS:\r<br/>\r<br/>Fly around, collect coins, kill enemies, become something beautiful\r<br/>\r<br/>Arrow keys/WASD to move.\r<br/>Space to shoot.\r<br/>P to pause.\r<br/>H to show controls.\r<br/>1-6 to choose weapons (as you discover them).\r<br/>E to target the nearest enemy.\r<br/>Q or ESC to quit.\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTES:\r<br/>\r<br/>I wasn't sure about difficulty, so you are pretty much invincible - unless your bioforge dies, you will just keep respawning.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>sha256sum:\r<br/>cd87aa1a323b98b4733cccd918366c89a6dd6d65fcbf4cc3fb5bd09d30fa34e2  kinetic_dream.zip\r<br/>\r<br/>4af9c8bf8308496f44545c8d932afc10f99a7973d797b44dd95358ac7b27a4ae  kinetic_dream_java6.zip\r<br/>",

I made the all of the &quot;in-computer&quot; sound effects exclusively using Pro Tools's signal generator, layering square/sawtooth waves and white noise, which was a super fun exercise in manually doing what sfxr could do in a single click (heh!). The music uses samples from a Final Fantasy 6 soundfont run through Kontakt 5, and I really think when that FF6 timpani comes in, there's an otherwise buried part of my childhood that rushes back with each hit. Pretty cool to have these instruments of mass nostalgia at my fingertips, I love it! I don't really know what else to put here but please enjoy the battles! :)",

Sadly the core of my link between the theme and the game was how your ship would &quot;evolve&quot; as you got richer and bought more parts and made it bigger and better. With only 1 or 2 pieces to buy per type, that concept is completely lost...\r<br/>Also, the game has been tested  very little and is likely to be kinda buggy in some parts. But it should be winnable at least.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tips for playing:\r<br/>the longer distance you travel, the more new shops will buy your fish more at a higher rate.\r<br/>Also, the game goal is actually 10000, not a million, didn't have time to change the sadly crappy title screen.",

			"htmlDesc": "Devolve today with Cellvolution!\r<br/>\r<br/>A simple but engaging action/strategy game where you must navigate your cell to avoid and consume other devolved cells. As you progress through the infinite amount of levels evolution gets progressively harder as the cells grow in size. Only forward thinking and luck will get you through to the next level of evolution.\r<br/>\r<br/>The premise is straight forward, your cell randomly changes color and this color tells you the other cells you can pair with or need to avoid. You have limited health and time but must consume a growing number of matching cells to level up. Don't worry, you will have power ups like speed boost, or health refills to help you in your evolution. Be careful, one power up provides you the ability to evolve quickly but with it comes greater difficulty, you will see.\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS:\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls are simple, &quot;WASD&quot; or Left-Right-Up-Down will allow you to navigate between crowded cell filled areas or avoid unfriendly cells coming after you.

Some levels include  mutations you can apply to your creatures in case you need them to evolve more useful traits.  Some of the mutations need to be activated by clicking on the creatures.  The rest of the rules and behaviors are left for you to discover.  \r<br/>\r<br/>The game includes ten levels; I wish I had more time to make more of them.  All levels are solvable.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Tested in Chrome and IE9 on Windows 7 and Chrome on Mac OSX.  The sound was a little unreliable in Windows Firefox, but it worked OK otherwise.  \r<br/>\r<br/>HINT:  Some folks are having trouble with the fourth level, the first one with the unicorn guys.  There's a very hard way to do this level and also a fairly easy one.  If you think the timing is close to impossible here, you're doing the very hard way.  I have a spoiler video linked above that shows the &quot;right&quot; way.\r<br/>\r<br/>POST COMPO BUG FIX: I figured out why the sound wasn't working in Firefox (also Opera) - I hadn't connected the .ogg files I made to the source so that they loaded.  This was a 31-character-long one line addition - otherwise I've changed nothing.  If you use Firefox or Opera and want to hear the sounds, please use the Post-Compo link above.",

He is very motivated to be someone, but there are obstacles on his way. \r<br/>Grown up monsters will try to discourage him from growing up and bully you.\r<br/>Fortunately, his friends will support him and cheer him up.\r<br/>\r<br/>His evolution into someone good or evil will depend on positive and negative support from his environment.\r<br/>\r<br/>The more positive energy you get, the better you will become. \r<br/>However, if you receive too much negative energy, your character will give up and become a bad person.\r<br/>\r<br/>GOAL:\r<br/>====\r<br/>Each word will affect your determination represented by your positive energy points (blue bar).\r<br/>Positive word will give you positive points.\r<br/>Negative word will make you loose positive points.\r<br/>\r<br/>You start at 100 points, try to get 1000 points to finish the game.\r<br/>The game is over if you reach 0 positive points (determination loss) OR 1000 negative points.\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS:\r<br/>=====\r<br/>- Use the arrow keys (left and right) to move forward and backward on screen.  Try collect positive words and avoid negative ones.\r<br/>- Double dash by pressing an horizontal arrow key twice.\r<br/>- Jump with the up arrow key. \r<br/>- You can double jump in mid-air.\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE:\r<br/>- 28/08/2012 : Added Web Player link (I forgot Unity3D could do this one...)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun !\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>",

There is a win condition and I am interested if anyone is bored enough to see it!\r<br/>\r<br/>Light on the theme, and a bit abstract.  But it's a game, I made it in 48 hours, and I like it.  Web version is available now; additional builds/media will be available sometime tomorrow.\r<br/>\r<br/>I guess I missed the window for the regular competition?  I swear that in the past there was a grace period for making the submission itself; but the option isn't there.  Oh well I guess.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope some people enjoy the game!\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: Going to put instructions here after all.\r<br/>\r<br/>The objective of the game is to evolve the cube.  After a certain amount of time, cubes on the larger cube will start flashing.  Clicking on the flashing cubes breaks them up and sends them to the orbiting nodes.  At any time, you can click on an orbiting node to transfer the cube energy inside of it to the main cube.\r<br/>\r<br/>Clicking the flashing cubes fast enough, and without clicking non-flashing cubes, will start a combo (Shown in the upper left).  Higher combos increases the rate at which cubes start to flash.  It's 5 cubes per multiplier, and you have 5 seconds between cubes before the multiplier resets.  Hitting a non-flashing cube resets your combo.\r<br/>\r<br/>I had intended to put a time element in the game so that there's some point/competition but it's not in there, maybe use a stopwatch? ;)  It's a silly game anyway, but it was fun to make and maybe with some love it could become something greater.",

The dot will move ahead (from the middle of the area straight up) and you can control the following:\r<br/>- &quot;Turn At&quot;: If you set it to X, it will turn in every Xth turn, by the amount specified in &quot;Turn Amount&quot;. Turning happens before spawning. \r<br/>- &quot;Turn Amount&quot;: The degree of turning. Zero degree is continuing in a straight line, negative amounts are turning to the left (-1..-179, -90 is the square angle.) Positive amounts will turn the dot to the right, 90 again is the square angle, 180 is turning back. \r<br/>- &quot;Spawn At&quot;: Setting it to Y, in every Yth turn a new dot is generated at the same position, but turned by the &quot;Child Dir Offset&quot; amount. \r<br/>- &quot;Child Dir Offset&quot;: New dot's will be turned by this amount relative to the current direction of their parent. The valid values are the same as for &quot;Turn Amount&quot;. This affects only the direction, not the location.\r<br/>Example: When spawning, your dot has a direction of -90 (going straight to the left). The CDO is set to 100. Your new dot will inherit the -90, then the 100 is added, so the new dot will have a direction of +10, which is a bit to the right from straight up. \r<br/>- &quot;Die At&quot;: Dots will die after living for this much turns. Spawning happens before dieing. New dots start with age=0.\r<br/>\r<br/>In Challenge Mode, you need to match your rule to the randomly generated one. The information message above the canvases will tell you how many of the five are currently matched. Tip: Before doing challenges, experiment with the values, so that you have a general understanding of the effects caused by changing a parameter. Start with simple turning first, then play with the &quot;Die At value&quot;, then with the Spawing and CDO. \r<br/>\r<br/>In Freeform mode, all you need to do is to experiment with different rules. I hope you will share any interesting rules with us in the comments, should you find one. :D\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy!",

The story is quite fuzzy, something about transgender, transsexuality and transhumanism. Something about the evolution that we, as a species, are performing every day.\r<br/>\r<br/>TO PLAY: Use the arrows to translate the text that is moving in order to collide with other texts. \r<br/>\r<br/>To do this project I use, as a beginner, Unity 3D and Garage Band.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thank you for playing :)",

I probably shouldn't have spent so much time working on touch controls during the compo though...\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, your units 'evolve' with new attachments as the game goes on, and your strategy for controlling your squad 'evolves' as their capabilities change.\r<br/>\r<br/>The winner of each of the first 3 rounds gets first choice of items. The winner of the final round wins the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS:\r<br/>PLAYER 1: arrow keys\r<br/>PLAYER 2: WASD\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTES:\r<br/>- Bumping into other units locks up their controls temporarily, but does *not* hurt them, even though I totally made it look like it does.\r<br/>- The items aren't vertically flipped for the second (top) player, so they'll have to do it mentally if they want to correctly predict what slot will be filled.\r<br/>- If you can't see the whole resolution in the web build, try a downloadable version.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used: Unity + RagePixel + CFXR + Garageband\r<br/>Keywords: web, bullet-hell, bullet hell, shmup, multiplayer",

Free the frozen pinballs by evolving their surrounding blobs. When a pinball collides with a blob, the blob will take on some of the color of the pinball; the closer its color to the frozen pinball it encircles, the smaller it gets.

			"htmlDesc": "PREREQUISITES-\r<br/>-Python 2.7 and it's respective stable Pygame release must be installed.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Hello hello helllloooooo developers, this is my first Ludum Dare. Also, my first heart attack. You see, I was in the middle of the development of a clever, smart, smooth comedy puzzle. However, like all good things that happen to me, I encountered a problem with it and therefore gave up on it and tucked it away in a dark corner where I was sure to never see it again. Meaning, my &quot;Open This Folder When I get a Girlfriend&quot; folder.\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, second of all, the INSTRUCTIONS and DEDICATED TO NEIL ARMSTRONG text files are blank. That is because I realized I forgot to fill them out after I had already compressed, uploaded, and shared my game link, and am too much of a lazy bum to update it. So I will just write those here.\r<br/>SUMMARY-\r<br/>-This is a local multiplayer game where the 2 players control a blue single-celled organism, and a red single-celled organism. The objective of the game is to collect 10 black cells, which will randomly appear at random locations on the screen. The first organism to collect 10 cells will evolve straight to the age of Space Flight. My innovative Indie game element is that if the 2 cells touch each other (bow chicka bow wow), they BOTH will lose ALL their cells. By &quot;touch each other&quot; I mean fully overlap one another- one organism can go halfway through another, for example. This gives a nice twist to the gameplay where one has to avoid the other player while trying to race them to the same spot. This can lead to some very Scooby-Doo chase scenes.\r<br/>-To move, the players mash their WASD or arrow buttons, depending on the player. The faster they mash the buttons, the faster they will go and the more they will complain and not play this game anymore.\r<br/>-An announcer, who I like to call &quot;Very Low Budget Crappy GLaDOS&quot;, will announce things at specific points of the match.\r<br/>-Though there is no distinct Multiplayer or Singleplayer mode, if you have no one else to play with, try to keep the balls as close together as possible and to follow the black ball. Make sure that the balls are touching(without one fully overlapping the other so your score doesn't get reset), while still maintaining a speed to follow the black ball with. If the organisms overlap or disconnect, you lose.  Ambidextrous players will have quite the advantage.\r<br/>INSTRUCTIONS-\r<br/>Player One(Blue/Smurf)-\r<br/>W-Up\r<br/>A-Left\r<br/>S-Down\r<br/>D-Right\r<br/>Player Two(Red/Commie)-\r<br/>Well, the arrow keys.. You know.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Lastly, I would like to dedicate this game to Neil Armstrong. I find it tragic that the theme was Evolution, and man who helped in the evolution of science and technology so much as Neil Armstrong passed away. Rest in peace. You were the very first to leave this world, and you do it now once again. Safe travels, Commander.\r<br/>",

The mines reopened. The money poured back into the county as the international Cybernetic Implant market boomed. To avoid the distasteful strikes and greed of capitalist mining companies, AI Entities were implemented to run the country's larger concerns. South Africa was important again. It was the only country that seemed to have an endless supply of the metal needed for complete cybernetic integration. \r<br/>\r<br/>De Beers, once almost bankrupt, became a &quot;world power&quot; and extend their operation to the manufacture and sales of Cybernetic Implants. Those who could afford the implants became more powerful, more intelligent, lived longer, looked beautiful and, of course, wealthier. Technology and science prevailed. Workers were given implants so they could lift and extract more from the deep tunnelling mines. \r<br/>\r<br/>While De Beers continued its climb as a world player inequality and disparity grew drastically. The Cities started to separate, half slums and ghettos and the rest pristine technological wonders. The Rand became the most sought after currency in the world. The Government started to appoint De Beers board members into all the major positions and they grew fat. \r<br/>\r<br/>For some time this turmoil reigned over the country. Protests, uprisings and strikes were quelled with hysterical violence. How can a mere man compete with the CRP (Cybernetic Regulation Police)? These &quot;policemen&quot; were hardly men; their augmentation was almost complete. Their regulations were only there to protect those already in power. \r<br/>\r<br/>The 11 Judges of the Constitutional Court led the only modicum of resistance in favour of the Old Democracy. The Court was allowed to exist only while the Government tried to maintain their international image as the &quot;Rainbow Nation&quot;. They had no real power; their decisions were never implemented; they served as a glorious illusion of the prosperity and sanctity of augmented life. They did however organise rallies, spend days in court holding the De Beers board members in contempt and generally being a nuance. They continued this meagre resistance for years, never quite achieving what they hoped to, never quite brave enough. \r<br/>\r<br/>Over the years the city has been torn apart. The implants gave those who could afford them too much power, too much wealth and too much beauty. It drove all of them mad. \r<br/>\r<br/>It was after the 2022 murder of the Chief Justice that action was taken. The ConCourt rallied the people and isolated the CBD from the rest of Joburg. They built massive walls, expelled most of those who had implants and declared themselves independent. \r<br/>\r<br/>For 8 years following they were under besieged. The siege only ended after those on the other side of the wall lost their sanity. The implants drove them mad and they became violent scavenging animals. De Beers and South Africa collapsed. All that remained was the ConCourt and the 2 million in the CBD.\r<br/>\r<br/>Creative Commons; Map Data is Copyright &Acirc;&copy; 2012 AfriGIS (Pty) Ltd., Google.",

You can install it with the OALinst executable or launch the nosound version of the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Left, Right arrow:\tMove the character.\r<br/>Space:\t\t\tJump.\r<br/>Left Ctrl:\t\tFire.\r<br/>\r<br/>Alternatively you can use A, D, W to control the character (or the corresponding keys if you don't have a qwerty keyboard) and Left Shift to fire.",

I (a vampire) want to change that, and so i seek to reanimate the corpse of Charles Darwin (rumoured to be a vampire, like me!). \r<br/>\r<br/>being a Vampire Is Not Very Fun is a grapple-platformer wherein a lonely young Vampire (ME!) aims to find Darwin's grave by running (WASD to move, and Shift to run), Jumping (Space), Wall Jumping (Space on a wall), and grappling (use the mouse, point and shoot). I can adjust zoom with the mousewheel. In the event that I am stuck, or the screen goes white, I can kill myself with the Escape key, and thereby 'escape' my immortal coil (har, har).\r<br/>\r<br/>I'll need to be careful if I'm to unlock the secrets of Vampire-kind's evolution!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Just unzip and run 'Vamp-Ire' to get moving. sound is a MUST as this game has no subtitles.\r<br/>\r<br/>Made in xna game studio. Keyboard and mouse required, nothing graphically fancy. Should run fairly well on just about anything.\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: XNA/.net redistributables required! I will try to sort out an 'installer' version that will download them for you but I  have to go to work now.\r<br/>\r<br/>Source in zip file on the off chance you actually want to look!

When any two Mesh pixels overlap, they're knocked loose and float freely. Pick up the free pixels to regenerate yourself. If your &quot;brain&quot; pixel collides with anything, your entire Mesh will explode (game over).\r<br/>\r<br/>Not Working: The idea was that you'd add a pixel onto your Mesh at the end of every level (evolution). Play would start each level in the same &quot;+&quot; form, but as you gathered more pixels you'd grow into your final form.\r<br/>\r<br/>I was planning to make ~10 or 20 levels (there's an AI system complete for setting up paths for the AIs and the engine supports resizing to much smaller pixel resolutions). After 20 &quot;set&quot; levels, you'd enter a free-form arena where you battle your ancestors!\r<br/>\r<br/>Stretch Goal: I'd also love to add support for multi-tier Meshes--a &quot;mount point&quot; would act as a second-tier brain. You could add pixels to either your main Mesh or your sub-Mesh, and even define paths for your sub-Mesh (think rotating blades or Dhalsim-arms).\r<br/>\r<br/>Mega Stretch: It would be pretty easy to store all these in a database and load random enemy meshes to battle against (offline). It would be harder, but pretty cool, to make a live battle arena.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>source link is the specific commit for the entry--i'll probably keep tinkering with it, but that source will construct the SWF i linked to as my &quot;play&quot; entry",

I've created a simulation where cells of different hues are floating around in a square petri dish. If you hold down the mouse button and drag over the cells, they would be killed and instantly be replaced by a copy of a random cell, thus representing the offspring that would replace it. Eventually, if you're selective in your approach, you'll end up with a field of similar cells. You'll also notice that it gets easier to change the cells to their desired characteristics as you get to the end.\r<br/>\r<br/>This project was created with help from Foundation HTML5 Animation with Javascript by Billy Lamberta and Keith Peters. I also referenced a function to convert HSV to RGB from Nan C. Schaller.  Due to the nature of Dropbox, all of the source code is inside the HTML file.

			"htmlDesc": "For my second Ludum Dare entry I decided to try for something a bit more ambitious:  a simulator modeling fictional Religious groups under various evolutionary pressures.  The design required way too much, even with my attempts to keep things simple.\r<br/>\r<br/>Windows .exe and cross-platform jar (tested in Ubuntu) are now up.  To compile from source, you'll need LibGDX (~Aug 24, 2012).\r<br/>\r<br/>&quot;Gameplay&quot; is limited to tweaking the three stats for your Religion and letting it rip.  There are various controls to pause and change the speed of the simulator.  Esc will quit the app (from most screens--might have forgotten one or two).\r<br/>\r<br/>I had plans to allow the player to mutate their Religion a bit every few dozen to hundred years or so, but even with that it'd be a bit difficult to call it a game.  The traits that you can tweak are mostly violent (dramatic population changing) ones--I would have liked to have modeled peaceful conversions if there was time, as well as more frivolous stuff.  The sim also needs some way to depict splitting / Schisms in addition to mutation, to really be an evolutionary sim.  Oh well.  At least it runs.\r<br/>\r<br/>The sole sound effect was made with bfxr, and the graphics were made with Paint and GIMP.",

They can reproduce a lot and that causes a mutation on their attributes, creating a natural selection of your minions.Some have special powers, like flying (or having loads of HP)\r<br/>\r<br/>The game objective is to carry the purple crystals (one by one) to the altar.\r<br/>\r<br/>Still a lot of unexpected behaviors my happen in the game, and the game is very easy. I plan to polish it a little during the week!\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you like it :)",

			"htmlDesc": "\r<br/>My game for this entry (my first LD) is talking about a cell (wow!).\r<br/>\r<br/>This cell is very egocentric and narcissic. Located on the human brain, she is thinking about looking for a new body (yes, this cell can control bodies), because she finds the human body not good enough for her.\r<br/>\r<br/>So she jumps off the human, and accidentally gets on a rat. For her, controlling a rat is horrible, so she begins running and searching a new body.\r<br/>\r<br/>After one level, she finds a dog. She continues to search a better body, though.\r<br/>\r<br/>I ran out of time, so the game only includes 4 (big) levels. I will provide a link to a version with more levels soon.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my first LD and it was a very, very great experience (very hard too, as this game is my second C++ game on PC).\r<br/>\r<br/>You can find my post-mortem here: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/08/28/egocell-post-mortem/\r<br/>\r<br/>I streamed on http://twitch.tv/adbook/ if you want to see the records.\r<br/>Now, let me sleep for three days, please !\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Note that the game is not complete.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: I noticed a huge flaw in the way the collisions were performing: if the player falls from too high or comes in a platform the wrong way, It would occasionate a buffer overflow and eventually a SEGFAULT (wich would cause a crash...). The same with the screens between each level. I fixed these two flaws, and by some board effect, the player's jump became stable (so the bug was due to some wrong collision detection), as did the mobs jumps. I uploaded the fixed version to avoid SEGFAULTS and memory leaks !",

Besides my programmer art being horrible, I was trying to capture the feel of late 70s, early 80s arcade games.\r<br/>\r<br/>I decided in my entry to show the actual evolution of video games themselves, and this is what I ended up with.\r<br/>\r<br/>My game was written with Construct 2. I loved working with it, it was my first time and I think its a great tool.\r<br/>\r<br/>My source is on github, I included the link.\r<br/>\r<br/>All comments are welcome!\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: This is a WEBGL/HTML5 game. It is best played in the newest chrome and barring that the newest Firefox. Some of the effects will not show up in IE and it may run slowly if your browser hasn't been restarted in a while.\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE 2: The controls for the final round are: Arrow keys move you around, you auto aim towards the mouse cursor, HOLD the left mouse button to fire. Right mouse button will fire the breakout ball but you can only have one in play at a time. Running into it will pick it up again and you can then reshoot it.",

			"htmlDesc": "An arcade/tower defense/coffee break strategy game, made with Python &amp; Pygame. Keep the enemies from becoming too specialized at wrecking your defensive turrets by juggling them like a pro.\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions (now with a gameplay video):\r<br/>\r<br/>The round object at the left is a generator, which your job is to protect. Use your mouse to connect it to turrets - left-click to draw and right-click to cut a wire. \r<br/>\r<br/>There are three genes in play: red, green, and blue. \r<br/>-While an enemy is attacked by a turret with its color, it's immune to damage.\r<br/>-When an enemy is killed by a turret, the enemy gene pool adapts to the turret's color by one fitness point, meaning that enemies of that color become more common.\r<br/>-Additionally, an enemy gene levels up after every 4 fitness points, spawning more powerful enemies. Namely, the blue gene will give more health, the green one more range, and the red one more attack power.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can also take advantage of genes.\r<br/>-A turret that kills an enemy adds the enemy's gene to its gene bank. \r<br/>-A turret's gene bank can hold 3 genes. \r<br/>-The cumulative genes of all turrets _connected to the generator_ can be used to build more turrets in the white slots. Select the genotype of the turret by clicking on the bottom left colors; then connect a white slot to the generator and click on it. Building a turret costs 1 gene of its color.\r<br/>-Additionally, if a turret's gene bank has 3 same genes in a row, you can level up that gene by clicking on the turret and pressing the double helix button. Turrets built after that will be more powerful in the same manner as enemies.\r<br/>\r<br/>Knowing all that, try to keep the enemy gene pool in control by strategically connecting and disconnecting turrets from the generator. The goal is simply to survive as long as you can; your score is the amount of enemies killed.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's challenging but addictive - just the way I like my games - so don't give up.",

Each part of DNA allow you to improve your species and to make your cows stronger and gorgeous !\r<br/>\r<br/>You first chose where to use your first 10 points of dna to start your species, then the game begin. There's also bonus stars that you can collect. When you've gathered 10 of them, you gain a bonus DNA point !\r<br/>\r<br/>You can't attack wolves but you can defend yourselves. Put some DNA points in defenses to grow powerful horns and outnumber them by breeding new cows.\r<br/>\r<br/>Each turn (press ENTER to end the turn) all your cows regain there Action Points and can move again, and they produce food, in proportion of their remaining action points. Staying in grass allow them to build strong food ressources and to go on expedition in the dirt, when there's no food and where they can starve and die quickly ! Also a well fed cow is a more resillient cow against wolves.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Put points in Speed to have move Action Point per turn.\r<br/>- Put points in Food Production to eat the grass faster and make more personnal food supply quickly.\r<br/>- Put points in Food Consomation to have more starving resistant cows, that consume less food per turn.\r<br/>- Put points in Defense to get bigger and bigger horn that retaliate damages to wolves when they attack your cows.\r<br/>- Put points in Evade to lower the distances where wolves can see your cows.\r<br/>\r<br/>Important - the remaining stats are not currently implemented and therefore are useless : Food cap, Temperature tolerance (also IMPORTANT : this one gives your cows a santa hat when 10 points are reached :-), Breed time, Starting specimens (I fixed it to 2 for this &quot;release&quot;.\r<br/>\r<br/>HOW TO PLAY\r<br/>At the begining of the level you've 2 cows to place on the map. Press space then click. The rest of the manipulation is pretty intuitive. Still :\r<br/>\r<br/>Cows produce food each turn, in function of the soil and in function of their own eating skill.\r<br/>They store this food in their stomach but meanwhile they consume a part of it each turn. The more they are evolved in food consomation, the less they consume. A starving cow that has no remaining food ressource dies sadly.\r<br/>A male and a female can breed a calf when they're both full of food. It consumes half of their ressources and put them out of action point until the end of the turn. Calf are cute and also defensless, wolves eat them instantly. Calves grow after 10 turns.\r<br/>You can't attack wolves but you can eventually defeat them with a high defense skill. You can also blowk them with braves cow that will sacrifice to help the other ones to continue further on the map.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Notes : All made in XNA C# with visual studio 10. All sprites made by me with paint.net. The whole stuff is terribly incomplete, still I'm a bit proud of it : some parts are finished and there's 'something playable'. I hope I'm going to continue this : real levels, more ressources, more rules, component (temperature etc.), more enemies, a MENU and a decent interface, etc.\r<br/>I started with a WAY wider idea about stuff evolving in environement, I quicky had to reduce the stuff to 1/2 main actors and I think I lost a lot about &quot;Evolution&quot;, but there's still some part of it.",

You gain a longer tail by clearing levels.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Note\r<br/>----\r<br/>I didn't get around to testing on anything other than OS/X, so i hope it works on other platforms as well. ",

No surprise), but I'm quite proud of this game.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is a prologue, which I strongly suggest you watch. This will give the setting and the story. There is also text in some levels, giving the minimum amount of info to play the game. But you really should go through the prologue. It's basically the whole story. Really. Please.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Arrows/WAD    - move and jump\r<br/>Space         - use Posi (when you have it)\r<br/>Right/D/Space - advance text\r<br/>\r<br/>Tips:\r<br/>-You need to collide with the center of the portal to go to the next level.\r<br/>-If you don't land on top of the ground, you will pass through it\r<br/>-You can miss a platform by a few pixels and still 'pull yourself onto it'\r<br/>\r<br/>(All of these features are by design, not bugs)\r<br/>Anyway, thanks for playing. I hope you enjoy it!

The game evolves as people develop new strategies and as more people play. Games will get longer the farther players get over time. Games will get harder the better people play.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is written in HTML 5 and Javascript technologies. Our rendering layer is Canvas. The game will run across a wide variety of browsers and platforms. To support ghost saving and retrieval we pushed our website and service up to Azure. Our database is running on SQL Azure.\r<br/>\r<br/>All of the code is original, even the Math libraries originally imported were mostly rewritten to improve the overall performance and feel of the game. We also created more than 95 unique images for use in the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>We experimented with social integration as well so you can &quot;Like&quot; our game on Facebook or you can &quot;Tweet&quot; your scores. We hope that this allows you to see how your friends are doing and maybe find them flying against you. Each ghost is tagged with your user name so when you first hit the page make sure you enter your name. Everytime someone dies to your ghost they'll know it was you!\r<br/>\r<br/>The entire process took 5 developers a little over 100 man hours totalling 11,000 lines of code churn. A pretty intense undertaking.\r<br/>\r<br/>Team Members:\r<br/>Justin Nafziger\r<br/>Ty Taylor\r<br/>Justin Rogers\r<br/>Christopher Kawasaki\r<br/>Nathan Furtwangler",

If you kill just the weak ones, the new ants will be stronger, if you kill the strong ones the weak ants will breed.\r<br/>\r<br/>How do the robots work?\r<br/>Each robot consist out of parts, needing at least a core (body) and one other part to survive.\r<br/>There are two buildings, a stealmine and baracks, and two materials, steal and synthetics.\r<br/>Each robot produces synthetics - more, if he has a &quot;Syntheter&quot; - steal is produced inside a stealmine.\r<br/>You can build a stealmine on stealdeposits (black), and baracks on grass (green) or stone (gray).\r<br/>To create a robot you need to produces enough parts (inside a barack) and then create a robot out of it. Each robot can have at most one part of each type.\r<br/>Robots can stand still, move to a point and attack ants.\r<br/>If a robot does not have enough energy, he can't move. To get more energy (weapons and the syntheter need much) the robot can contain a &quot;reactor&quot; or be near baracks or stealmines, because nearing to buildings there is more energy. A full robot - with a core/body, legs, reactor, syntheter and both weapontypes needs to have baracks near to have enough energy.\r<br/>\r<br/>The ants decide themselves to idle, to move, to attack or to breed - that's the reason the game is called AInts vs Robots. Ants need no ressources.\r<br/>The Robots have less AI, but shoot themselves when they shall attack.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is controlled nearly complete with the keyboard:\r<br/>Arrows: Move Camera\r<br/>Mouse Wheel: Zoom Camera\r<br/>W,A,S,D: move cursor (green block)\r<br/>Change module to produce: N\r<br/>Build: B (stealmine on stealdeposit, baracks on grass/stone)\r<br/>Produce module: P (while the cursor is above baracks)\r<br/>Create robot: R\r<br/>Move robot (to the cursor): M\r<br/>Attack ants (near the cursor): T (like &quot;tackle&quot;)\r<br/>Equip robot: E (while it is in baracks)\r<br/>Change robot selection: PageUp, PageDown\r<br/>\r<br/>The selected robot is shown at the top of the screen in the middle, at the side of it the next robots to change to with PageUp and PageDown.\r<br/>In the lower left corner the current selected module to produce is shown, right of it all modules lying at the baracks (selected by the cursor).\r<br/>\r<br/>I have prepared four maps (which are stored as images), because of the lack of a menu a random one is chosen.\r<br/>\r<br/>For the game I used my own little XNA frontend library (so C#, XNA and .NET).\r<br/>Because of the lack of time (and what you can read below &quot;Annotation&quot;) I was not able to release a version with Mono/MonoGame for Linux/Mac.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Annotation:\r<br/>\r<br/>Since I have huge performance drops since today evening (when I added breeding), I was not able to add many sounds, a menu, more animations or any music. The game may not be playable if I do not find the bug the next days and upload a new version. I have already profiled the game and removed/changed everything which needed a lot of time, but it has not become better (strange, because I did not add time intensive code before the first performance drops came). \r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately I did not commit the last perfectly running version to SVN, which did not had breeding (so no evolution), but was a nice RTS (with robots, ants, production and fighting).\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Conclusion:\r<br/>\r<br/>It was a lot of fun to program a whole weekend, even if I am not satisfied with the result. 48 hours are enough for a small, neat game, but not enough for a huge project, so I need to plan to do less next time. I needed a lot time to create the models, so I am going to write a blender export script for my own XML model format, because with blender I should be able to create models faster. Maybe I will use 2D graphics next time, for sure I will take some more looks at Mono and MonoGame. \r<br/>\r<br/>I hope, you (who have read the text till the end) will have fun playing the game (if that is possible - I hope I will find the bug).\r<br/>",

I'm looking forward to playing a load of games over the next few weeks.\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, about the game...\r<br/>\r<br/>I had a hunch Evolution would be the theme so had an idea in my head from the start. The end result is not too far from the initial vision although several shortcuts had to be taken to finish in time and I'm not entirely happy with a few elements of the game - the lack of any music being one. \r<br/>\r<br/>I seem to have mainly been making action/arcade type games lately and wanted to try my hand at something a little more abstract. I'm also interested in finding out how I can direct the player towards the games objectives without actually telling them directly what to do. To this end the game contains no instructions other than the title &quot;Evolve&quot;. \r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you enjoy it.",

I fixed it, but nothing else about the content.\r<br/>\r<br/>To play: click to start game, then use the up and down arrows to select an organism. \r<br/>\r<br/>You have to make it to the end without letting it die!\r<br/>\r<br/>-----\r<br/>\r<br/>I can't believe I got this in, barely in time, I nearly had a heart attack! \r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately I only got the mechanics fully working about 10 minutes before the deadline, so I only had that time for level design! I haven't even had a chance to try it out yet :D \r<br/>\r<br/>I will work on the levels and then upload a post-compo version. \r<br/>\r<br/>Used Stencyl, Adobe Illustrator and GarageBand (no loops this time). \r<br/>\r<br/>Let me know what you think, and if you played just the original, please come back to try the next version! \r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks!\r<br/>\r<br/>http://azurenimbus.com\r<br/>http://twitter.com/azurenimbus",

Tweaking the simplified form till it becomes fun as well is another thing altogether. I wish I had more time to do that.\r<br/>Still, I had a great time rushing through my first Ludum Dare compo! Thanks for organizing this! :)",

You are the cat. The AI robots try to destroy you, and you try to destroy them. \r<br/>Every robot is controlled by a simplified neural network. After every round, the best neural networks make it to the next round, and duplicated to form a full squad. The new AIs are slightly mutated, and tadaa! We got evolution! \r<br/>\r<br/>And btw. This is in space. :D\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>I guess this would have otherwise been a compo entry if I hadn't taken the graphics engine source from my previous project ;D\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>I didn't have time to do any music or sounds because of the time the  programming took.

Also the background (music) evolves while you journey forward. 32 colors is a reasonable amount. Can you beat this?\r<br/>\r<br/>The game may seem very easy at the beginning, but spare your health ;). Controls and some explanations are shown ingame.\r<br/>\r<br/>Few technical details:\r<br/> * The game will use the resolution of the current main display.\r<br/> * Use the &quot;-windowed&quot; argument to start a 800x600 window.\r<br/> * Should run quite good on older computers. The fullscreen effects are not blindingly fast. Window mode even works on Atom CPUs/ION platform.\r<br/> * On my 64bit Linux the 32bit version was not able to capture the mouse. Hope it works for you :/. Also there is a 64bit version for Linux.\r<br/>\r<br/>// Updated the Linux binaries with the fixes for blocking issues on some systems. Apparently that's ok with the rules.\r<br/>// (Old &quot;may crash&quot; version still available at http://dev.spectratic.de/Flrrr/)\r<br/>// There is a gameplay video available: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXDQNj0fSaA\r<br/>\r<br/>Known issue:\r<br/>Score does not count beyond the 32 goal, probably no fix for that as it would change the initial behavior.\r<br/>Guess that kills the &quot;endgame&quot; content :).\r<br/>You can cheat and keep moving after death as long as you don't release the keys.",

Your relationship with your girlfriend has devolved significantly over time.  Would it be possible to evolve it into something better?\r<br/>\r<br/>:NOTE: Once you see the &quot;Force Close&quot; screen after visiting the past, it means the scenario is complete.\r<br/>\r<br/>FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT, download the .apk and play as a person using a smartphone while you, yourself, are using a tablet such as the Nexus 7.  STAND UP AND TURN YOURSELF AROUND to look around the scene, just like the character in the game is doing.\r<br/>\r<br/>For the time being, the apk is hosted on my own site.\r<br/> I'll push it to Google Play once I can convince Unity to sign with my keystore.  \r<br/>\r<br/>The game is short, not complete, but open-ended and a huge mind trip.  Play around as much as you want.",

Tested with firefox and chrome with HD5850, GTX670, GTX560 and Quadro4000.\r<br/>\r<br/>The submission (goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~pknowles/blob-submit/) had some bugs, which didn't appear on my 660, so I've put together a &quot;post-compo version&quot; which should give an idea of what the game was meant to be.\r<br/>\r<br/>== The Game ==\r<br/>You are red. Only red blobs can be moved by you.\r<br/>The aim: to eat food (green), reproduce and attack blue, becoming the dominant blobs!\r<br/>Larger red/blue blobs will destroy smaller red/blue blobs.\r<br/>Eating a green blob will duplicate the eater, with size deviation - evolution :)\r<br/>You must balance eating and attacking (to cull your smaller blobs), encouraging evolution of larger red blobs.\r<br/>The game ends when you lose too many blobs or destroy a significant portion of blue blobs.\r<br/>\r<br/>Sorry to those of you without the hardware to run this. I built the game around my interest in GL shaders. The game itself runs almost entirely on the GPU and can happily handle blobs on the order of one million.\r<br/>\r<br/>== Controls ==\r<br/>Left drag to move red blobs. You &quot;draw&quot; force.\r<br/>Scroll to zoom (not entirely necessary).\r<br/>Right drag to pan.\r<br/>\r<br/>== Tech Details ==\r<br/>Each level is randomized at launch with perlin noise. I compute a signed distance field for collision detection with the level. Blobs move with a fragment shader, writing to a double buffered a floating point texture. Interaction is achieved by additively drawing density, velocity etc on to a texture which other blobs can read (These can be viewed by pressing tilde &quot;~&quot;). I count the number of remaining blobs similarly to mipmapping before reading a very small texture back to the CPU. The blobs are rendered by raycasting a density texture, similarly to parallax mapping, applying transmittance and environment mapping.\r<br/>\r<br/>",

The link with the theme may be hard to find, but it's there!\r<br/>\r<br/>You play as a red bubble, which keeps corrupting houses it lives in.\r<br/>\r<br/>About the controls, they're pretty simple:\r<br/>\r<br/>- Use the mouse to move the red bubble\r<br/>- Use left click to interact\r<br/>- Use F to toggle fullscreen\r<br/>- Use Q to quit\r<br/>\r<br/>I finished it about 10 minutes before the deadline, and ported it to Windows afterwhile. I had various issues with my compiler and SFML 1.6... So I had to adapt the code for the 2.0RC version. The source code is a real mess by the way! I'll probably upload an extended version on my website - mainly to clean the code, and add various elements I hadn't the time to include.\r<br/>\r<br/>For the tools:\r<br/>- SFML (Graphics)\r<br/>- OpenAL (Sounds)\r<br/>- The Gimp (Art)\r<br/>- LMMS (Musics / Sounds)\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you'll enjoy the game!",

We plan to carry on adding masks to the game, and hopefully eventually we will have one for each letter of the word 'Revolution', but for now the masks loop to give you more of a game to play.  See how many hearts you can reach!\r<br/>\r<br/>[UPDATE]\r<br/>31/08/12 - A bugfix version of Revolution has been uploaded, which may solve the problems people have been having with the game crashing on startup.  Please give it another go and leave a comment!\r<br/>\r<br/>Check out GIF animations of all the art from the game on our blog!\r<br/>\r<br/>Special thanks to our teammate for this round, Dan Holloway for writing the awesome soundtrack. Programming was done by Joseph Thomson and art was done Robert Thomson.\r<br/>\r<br/>Pre-compo synopsis:\r<br/>\r<br/>You spawn on the inside of a circle, headless, and all you seem to be able to do is run. You run around the inside of the circle, and then you see something fading into existance as you reach 1 full revolution. It's a mask! A very poorly made mask but a mask nonetheless, you put it on and when you channel your energy through it, a knife appears! floating and disembodied, how useful! especially since an enemy seems to have just spawned! headless, and what you think looked like an 'R', but it faded. You put your knife to work on the poor guy and you are alone once more. You run around a bit and as you reach another revolution you see, yes! another mask! You decide that this one looks noteably nicer, so you put it on and channel your energy through it again. A sword appears! and around the other side of the circle, another headless little guy, and a guy with a knife and a very familiar looking mask, one with an 'R' above him, and the other with an 'E' and they both seem to be coming towards you.",

			"htmlDesc": "This is &quot;Silent Game of Death&quot; the result of my first shot at Ludum Dare. I felt it went okey until 4 hours to the end when I realized I totally forgot about the audio! At that point I still had some major features left to fix so the game simply had a change of name, from &quot;Game of Death&quot; to &quot;Silent Game of Death&quot;, oh yeah you probably want to know what it's about!\r<br/>\r<br/>Silent Game of Death (SGOD) is a top-down shooter, you use the mouse buttons to control most of the action, the left button lets the ship shoot a stream of plasmabullets when held and by holding the right button the player attracts the ship towards the mouse. There is also a small help in case of emergency, press the spacebar and the ship overloads its main battery and lets out a huge energy burst! After letting out a burst the battery must recharge, preventing you too use it too often.\r<br/>\r<br/>The enemies in this game are no ordinary aliens, since the theme of this was &quot;Evolution&quot; I began to think about using a &quot;Game of Life&quot; simulation as the enemy, your goal is simple, all you have to do is destroy the game of life, when there is no more life you win. The simulation might kill it self after a while, but that's not the points. It's all about speed, destroy all the life and prevent the simulation from evolving to set a new fastest time.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is not a complete game, there is still a lot to add to it and I will. There is only one map shipping with this game, it contains a couple of &quot;gliders&quot; and some &quot;spinners&quot;, after that the maps are randomly generated, but saved to the disk. This means that the next time you play, you can try to set a new high score(fastest time) for that specific map!\r<br/>\r<br/>Ok, I feel like I covered most of it. Enjoy yourself and try to have fun with my game (even if it has no audio in it).\r<br/>\r<br/>Joakim Rosenstam",

Your goal is to reach the right end of the level.\r<br/>\r<br/>This ended up being more of a genetic computing demonstration than a game (look in the source code if you are interested).\r<br/>\r<br/>The 'controller' object takes a set of 16 traits and creates genes by picking random traits and sticking them together.\r<br/>\r<br/>Enemies can only acquire genes on spawn, not lone traits, so they acquire some interesting combinations.\r<br/>\r<br/>Natural selection is implemented. Enemies that do damage to the player (or other enemies) get to spawn offspring instantly. If the game needs enemies, it will pick an existing enemy to clone and give a few new genes. Apart from dealing damage, proximity to the player gives an edge.\r<br/>\r<br/>The three key parameters are:\r<br/>global.gene_pool_size, which dictates the number of random genes are in play\r<br/>\r<br/>global.traits_per_gene, which dictates the phenotype to genotype ratio\r<br/>\r<br/>and genes_per_monster\r<br/>\r<br/>Genes work in this game by modifying values already there. Genes can have positive or negative effects.\r<br/>\r<br/>Try experimenting and influencing which ones spawn descendents.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Esc - quit\r<br/>Up - jump\r<br/>Left - left\r<br/>Right - right\r<br/>\r<br/>Enemies:\r<br/>The red microbes.

It's been tiring, but really interesting.\r<br/>\r<br/>Basically, what we have here is a sandbox where we can see a population of creatures hang around, feed and, at fixed intervals, mate (or generate mutant clones of doom, if they're asexual). Creatures can generate the energy they need, or they may get it from eating nutrients or other creatures.\r<br/>\r<br/>My idea was to make a &quot;god game&quot; where you could use some powers to get a population satisfying a set of conditions (for example..get 3 blue carnivores) after a given number of generations. Powers would be things such as...exterminate an individual, increase the life degradation rate temporarily, create/remove natural nutrients (the small, still dots). Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to achieve that and lots of things that I thought about, but I guess this is OK for a couple of days (shared between programming and gaming ^^). \r<br/>\r<br/>More details on the readme file included in the *.zip. Source code is also there.\r<br/>\r<br/>Third-person libraries used: SDL, OpenGL, Boost.\r<br/>The font used is Arial.ttf.\r<br/>\r<br/>Good luck everyone, and I hope you enjoy the compo :)\r<br/>\r<br/>(Edited to update the dl link to a functional release executable)",

There are currently 5 evolutions. Get hit by anything and time will be added. Killing a creep will subtract time. Try to keep your time as low as possible!\r<br/>\r<br/>PERSONAL HIGHSCORE: \r<br/>Time: 7 seconds\r<br/>Evolution years: 6000 [last wave, completed]\r<br/>\r<br/>OTHER INFO:\r<br/>This is the second time I'm participating in a Ludum Dare competition. I'm really proud of my results, and I think I totally deserve a good night rest (indeed, I did not sleep). Moreover I hope you'll enjoy the game, and don't forget to read the included ReadMe file for tips &amp; controls! Good luck!\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATES:\r<br/>I'm planning on making updates in the near future.\r<br/>You can keep track of this game by going to my website: http://aquarel-games.weebly.com/index.html\r<br/>\r<br/>TOOLS USED:\r<br/>Gamemaker 8\r<br/>SFXR\r<br/>Cool Edit pro + Microphone [like 50% of everything is my voice :P]\r<br/>Fruity loops and Ejay.",

Try to have fun, i guess.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Arrow keys + Z/X/C\r<br/>WASD + I/O/P\r<br/>\r<br/>Tips:\r<br/>-You start with 2 pesky rabbits munching your trees. Expect that number to increase in some minutes;\r<br/>-Collect the fruits, make concoctions, throw them either at the trees or the fluffy devourers. The strategy is yours to ellaborate;\r<br/>-If you aim right, you can buff two trees at once with only one potion;\r<br/>-You can't win the game. You can just survive longer.\r<br/>\r<br/>-Potions are random. There's no way you can predict what are you going to throw next. But their colors are unique:\r<br/>*Red: Heals all plants hit to 100%\r<br/>*Green: Increases health regen on all plants hit\r<br/>*Light Blue: Increases growth rate on all plants hit\r<br/>*Pink-ish: Increases fruit rate on all plants hit\r<br/>*Orange: Incapacitates all creatures hit (Time depends on how many creatures are incapacitated)\r<br/>*Dark Blue: Awakens all incapacitated creatures",

An important mechanic that I didn't have time to implement was leadership - when you are &quot;possessing&quot; one of your creatures, the nearby ones would've followed your lead. As it is, when they are not possessed, they just have a simple AI that wanders, eats, and fights.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, I didn't really have time to balance the races, which would've made it challenging but possible to beat. The way it is right now, your race mitoses faster, so the player almost always wins without any effort on their part...\r<br/>\r<br/>Some other important stuff that I didn't have time to finish:\r<br/>- You can't actually ever evolve... that's kind of important, but I didn't have time to draw all the sprites and stuff... I was planning on having about four stages of evolution before a race gets to its final state.\r<br/>- Originally, there were three races, but again, no time. I guess that's not as big of a deal.\r<br/>\r<br/>ps: IF YOU ARE POSSESSING A CREATURE, R-CLICK TO LEAVE IT &lt;&lt; I don't think I made it clear enough in the in-game instructions.\r<br/>pps: The sound fx tend to freak out at the very end, so be forewarned.",

It is the story of an escaped test subject from a  secret government facility in which they were testing the effects of a recently discovered disease on humans.

You must help the apes defend their jungle with bananas and monkey poo against Nazi soldiers, velociraptors, and the evil Tyrannosaurus Reich.\r<br/>\r<br/>IMPORTANT NOTE: \r<br/>The standalone link includes the exe and content folder. If it does not run, or gives some sort of XNA error, you MUST use the installer instead (or install XNA). This happens because you cannot run the application without the XNA dependencies, and if you do not have them the installer will get them for you.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game plays like a standard TD, except that you place and upgrade towers with cards.  There are several types of cards, which determines the lower icon.\r<br/>\r<br/>Lower icon:\r<br/>-Wrench: Build tower/trap.  Play towers on open, non-path tiles. Play traps on the path.\r<br/>-Arrow: Upgrade tower.  Play this on a tower you have built.\r<br/>-Bolt: Affect enemies.  Play this anywhere on the map, it will affect all the enemies.\r<br/>\r<br/>What the card does specifically is determined by the top icon.\r<br/>Top icon:\r<br/>Wrench cards build the following towers:\r<br/>-Monkey Tree: good damage and rate of fire\r<br/>-Peanut Gallery: faster but weaker\r<br/>-Toilet Gibbon: slows down enemies\r<br/>-Banana Cannanon: slow, powerful, and long-range\r<br/>-Chimpanzer: good damage and rate of fire, hits enemies around target\r<br/>Wrench cards also build the following traps:\r<br/>-Thicket: slows enemies\r<br/>-Pricker bush: damages enemies\r<br/>-Pit trap: stuns an enemy\r<br/>-Banana Bomb: does lots of damage to a single enemy\r<br/>Arrow cards give the following upgrades:\r<br/>-Monkey fist: damage\r<br/>-Feather: rate of fire\r<br/>-Reticule: range\r<br/>-Fist/Feather/Reticule: All the upgrades of the previous three\r<br/>-Toilet paper: Toilet Gibbon's slow ability\r<br/>Bolt cards have the following effects:\r<br/>-No-Nazi sign: damages all enemies\r<br/>-Snowflake: slows all enemies",

I feel sure it'll work fine on OS X since there's no OS-specific code on it, but I can't know for sure since I don't own a Mac. Please feel free to try it out and report any bugs!\r<br/>\r<br/>REPORTING BUGS:\r<br/>Screenshots and a description of what you were doing at the time are the two most useful things I can get.\r<br/>\r<br/>KNOWN BUGS:\r<br/>&lt;fixed&gt; Null pointer exception if you pick an invalid cell type.",

I especially focused on the combat feedbacks, taking great ideas from Diablo 3 &amp; Street Fighter 4 : slow motion, shakes, loads of particles...\r<br/>\r<br/>Another thing I was really happy with were the character animations. You have to know : I can't draw. I mean, really. I never learned and if you ask me to draw a human face, it will look like a childish drawing of the monster under my bed. I'm just really bad at it. Digital painting is another story: I see it more like a technical thing rather than an artistic approach. The pixel grid is my friend. So, trying to animate a human character to make it look cool and powerful was really a huge challenge to me.\r<br/>\r<br/>A big problem in this Ludum Dare entry was the theme, Evolution. I first wanted to stick to something like Corporate Climber, but with combat gameplay. But the timing was too short, and making a decent beat-em-up needed lots of details and attention. So I gave up most of the &quot;evolution&quot; related ideas (climbing hierarchy and unlocking special moves). Maybe I will add them back later?",

Little did he know that in messing with pea genetics, he opened not only the door to understanding genes, but also prompted a freak accidental massive evolution among the peas. Now, 200 years after his experiment, his peas continue surviving and evolving and adapting, ever waging a war against the other color of pea.\r<br/>\r<br/> \r<br/>\r<br/>Supertrait fighters are the green peas, our heros, who gain new evolutionary traits by winning battles against the yellow peas, and lose traits when they lose battles. Every trait has great advantages in battle, but can have disadvantages too. Certain traits are weak against other traits, and like in nature, the Supertrait Fighters have no control over the traits they gain or lose.\r<br/>\r<br/> \r<br/>Press right arrow to charge the enemy, left arrow to retreat (press and hold to attempt an escape from battle), and repeatedly hit space bar to attack once the yellow peas are in sight.

			"htmlDesc": "The game is in the form of an Android APK. It was made for multi-touch devices, although there's a version you can play online (press CTRL/CMD to simulate multi-touch).\r<br/>\r<br/>And it kinda, sorta, maybe works! A lot was left out. Alas, it was fun, especially as a first Ludum Dare entry!\r<br/>\r<br/>Spawn pastas (by &quot;ordering&quot; them) and conquer the table! It is kind of challenging. There are right moments to spawn stuff.\r<br/>\r<br/>You CANNOT control the flying pasta. That's not the idea. The idea is to have autonomous flying pasta! They're sort of dumb sometimes, though. Pasta technology is still a work in progress.\r<br/>\r<br/>Be sure to check the plate's bills! They indicate the plate's state, like who's conquering it and who it belongs to (also indicated by the plate's colors).\r<br/>\r<br/>The game decidedly fails to explain the gameplay well and should be judged as such. But if you're curious about what it's trying to do, there's some more information in the postmortem:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/08/27/survival-of-the-tastiest-post-mortem/\r<br/>\r<br/>Known issues:\r<br/>* It may crash eventually after a long time (texture memory problems probably)\r<br/>* When you open the order menu, sometimes it doesn't let you close it anymore\r<br/>* On Android, you need to install Adobe AIR prior to running the game (you're automatically redirected when running it for the first time)\r<br/>* On Android, after the game ends, you can't restart it. You have to close it manually, either on the application settings, or calling the task switcher and swiping it away (Android 4+)\r<br/>* I lowered the quality of the images to around 60% on Androids to avoid memory issues, since I couldn't do a lot of debugging. Sorry for the eventual bad texture quality\r<br/>* On Android, the game will work on all devices that support AIR, but it's mostly meant for tablets; playing on phones will probably be frustrating",

			"htmlDesc": "The idea behind &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;, was that in the near future, those without money would be forced to fight for their lives in a spectator sport. With inspiration from the Hunger Games, politics, and the NES classic &quot;Shatterhand&quot;, I was aiming to create a deadly arena that is constantly evolving.\r<br/>\r<br/>Every 30-60 seconds, an alarm sounds, and you must return to the safe room. Once there, the outside will explode, and the arena will morph into a new, more powerful form. If you don't make it back in time, you die (or would had I finished). \r<br/>\r<br/>I unfortunately didn't get to implementing attacks or health, as the core mechanics took a long time to create, and I'm no artist, so that was taxing. All in all, I feel the project came out AMAZING for what I usually do in 48 hours, and I can't wait to carry on with this project and launch it for Halloween.\r<br/>\r<br/>As far the the theme goes, the idea was a play on &quot;Natural Selection&quot;. Additionally, the goal would be to evolve your skills faster than the growing arena, by collecting credit orbs which could be spent on upgrades. I didn't get that far, so for now, the evolution simply lies in the arena, and the play on Natural Selection.\r<br/>\r<br/>Platform - Flash / AS3\r<br/>\r<br/>Libraries / Frameworks - FlashPunk, My Personal Platformer BolierPlate Code (included).\r<br/>\r<br/>Graphics - Can't believe I did that good.

What will they evolve into?\r<br/>\r<br/>---------------\r<br/>\r<br/>My first roguelike-like-like, heavily inspired by the work of Michael Brough.\r<br/>\r<br/>Made with Flixel and FlashDevelop. Background images taken from photos I took on the first day of the compo. Pixels made in GraphicsGale. Sounds made with microphone + Audacity, and Increpare's bfxr.\r<br/>\r<br/>PS I used git this time and it was a dream. I didn't really end up needing source control (thankfully) but it was extremely easy to set up a private repo and then simply push it to github when I was done. Highly recommended!",

The longer they stay alive, the more likely subsequent enemies are to share their traits.  Stay alive as long as you can and try to get the highest score!\r<br/>\r<br/>There are 3 different weapons to use (Minigun, Laser, and Rockets) depending on the situation you find yourself in.  There are also 4 enemy traits: Health (green), Speed (purple), Intelligence (red), and Swarming.  The last one splits an enemy into multiple enemies each with a fraction of the total health.\r<br/>\r<br/>Its kind of difficult to tell, but new waves of enemies are generated based on the enemies that are currently alive.  So if lots of fast enemies are still alive, the next wave will contain even faster enemies.\r<br/>\r<br/>I had a lot of fun at my first Ludum Dare.  It was pretty hectic, but I think I made a pretty fun game with more polish than I was expecting for such a short development time.  Hope you enjoy playing!",

You can play the original game as I posted a link to it (only web version, executable is only &quot;valid&quot; compo version).\r<br/>\r<br/>********************* MAC USERS!!!! ********************\r<br/>\r<br/>I don't own a MAC, so I can't test the game under mac. Today I tested it in work and found that mac does not come with Java7, so I translated my game to Java6. If anyone happens to own a mac and the game runs, please tell me in the coments, so I can sleep pacefully, otherwise I'll have to wait untill Monday to test it again.\r<br/>\r<br/>(If it doesn't work, post all details you can, they may be helpfull, specially if you run it from console).\r<br/>\r<br/>Sorry for the inconvenience.",

There is also a parameter panel that allows modification of several key tank parameters.  With these and many other features, we're sure you'll find that it is a joy to evolve your SLT-2200R Robo-Tank into the workhorse you'll love.\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal in this training simulation is to retrieve all gold boxes from each level and spend as little time in &quot;Manual Mode&quot; as possible. If you spend more time in manual mode than the level's par time, you will have to play the level again.\r<br/>\r<br/>When a level loads it is recommended that you press the spacebar and put the tank in auto pilot mode. When a condition occurs that requires your attention, the tank will switch back into manual mode. Check the Action text at the bottom of the screen. If it is visible, it will tell you if an action needs to be recorder. To record an action, simply press 'R' until the &quot;Mode&quot; indicator indicates record mode. Perform the desired action, then either hit spacebar, or 'R' again to return. When an action is recorded for a condition, anytime the autopilot encounters that condition again, it will playback your recorded moves.  Note: Recording an action counts towards your Manual mode time.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls: \r<br/>\r<br/>&lt;Spacebar&gt; Toggles between manual mode and auto pilot\r<br/>E: Erase a previously-recorded action. (This can be done \r<br/>   in either mode.)\r<br/>&lt;ESC&gt;: Returns to intro screen\r<br/>S: Restarts a level\r<br/>P: Pause the game and access the tanks configurable parameters (these changes persist across levels)\r<br/>\r<br/>In Manual mode:\r<br/>\r<br/>Arrow Keys: Movement\r<br/>F: Fire (you can kill turrets with 3 shots)\r<br/>R: Record a control sequence for the currently shown action (if no action is shown, record mode cannot be entered)\r<br/>\r<br/>Remember, each level (except the last) has a maximum par time that you must be under in order to advance.\r<br/>",

So finished it can be in 72 hours and with our experiance. \r<br/>This time was the first time that we coded the game in pure JAVA. We usually use Game Maker but this time we wanted to create it with JAVA. \r<br/>\r<br/>We have a very unigue idea regarding the theme but it was not very well applyed due to lack of time! \r<br/>\r<br/>The plot is as following: \r<br/>You are trapped inside a house! You have to find you way out! To do this you will have to find tools which will help you out (You evolve).\r<br/>\r<br/>We hope that we will be able to create something bigger with this game as we think that it was good fun to develop in JAVA.\r<br/>\r<br/>Credits:\r<br/>Programmer: David (Dals )Skeppstedt, Andreas (Pandy) Brommund.\r<br/>Art and Sound: Anton (Begnert) Begnert.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks for this time! \r<br/>//DalsGames\r<br/>\r<br/>",

I am not sure if they are actually issues(Each branch has a pretty big hitbox around them).  I think it is more that once you place a fork\r<br/>in your branch, you cannot edit that branch any more which was intentional.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you are having trouble clicking on branches that you haven't already &quot;forked&quot; then that is a legitimate bug and it'd be good to know if that is the case, so I can fix it.\r<br/>\r<br/>I think this is a game.  I think the definition of game is more about &quot;playing&quot; than &quot;winning&quot;.  At the same time I think there isn't a formal definition of what a game is, that everyone agrees with.\r<br/>\r<br/>My definition of game is a little relaxed maybe. \r<br/>But it needs to be to inclusive otherwise things that are clearly games get left out, like the Sims say.\r<br/>But that is cool!\r<br/>\r<br/>Looking forward to playing all your entries!\r<br/>\r<br/>NB:\r<br/>The source is attached, with a FlashDevelop .proj file.\r<br/>I used git throughout the competition, but I did not include the repository as it greatly increases the file size.\r<br/>\r<br/>If anyone would like the git repository, just ask me on twitter @canyonoasis",

The game's &quot;gimmick&quot; (and the connection to the theme) is that the control scheme gets significantly more complex as you get further and players have to adapt to the new controls. This gimmick doesn't really show itself until maybe stage 8 or 10 or so, and the stages are rather difficult due to hastily done level design, so for most people it will just seem like a generic platformer that has nothing to do with the theme. And even for players who got to the later stages, the connection to the theme probably wouldn't have been obvious without this explanation. So I expect low marks for &quot;Theme&quot;, but I had fun making the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>About the two download links: I noticed a stupid bug right after the submission deadline passed, so I fixed it. The bug was easy to fix but fairly serious (the &quot;infinite&quot; lives on some difficulty settings were not actually infinite) so I think it's okay to rate the late version. However, the original version that was submitted before the deadline is still available by clicking the &quot;on-time&quot; link just in case.",

You have some random parts attached to you and other robots usually have more parts. When you die or run out time/fuel, you evolve, and gain either new parts or upgrades to your existing parts. If the game didn't break and I hadn't overslept I would have added bosses with special parts that would can only gain my killing them. \r<br/>The objective of the game is to survive as many levels as possible, as you only have limited lives but unlimited &quot;refuels&quot;.\r<br/>If you can actually survive the aggressive AI, then you will  evolve as planned, but when you die the game crashes.\r<br/>I would have tracked you guys' statistics with Mochi, but apparently it broke the game even more and therefore the Kongregate version doesn't load, at least not for me.\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun!\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT:\r<br/>I've fixed it and also made some slight balance changes and increased the size of the level.",

There's something exciting about seeing the map, with all sorts of interesting looking places just begging to be explored. I thought it would be fun to make a turn-based strategy tactics wargame based on this visual style.\r<br/>\r<br/>I created my game in HTML5 using jquery, because something like this doesn't need 3d rendering performance, and because it is very easy to turn the game into a mobile (android, ios and ouya) app using phonegap. \r<br/>\r<br/>I started by first drawing some typical fantasy map icons using marker on paper. After scanning in the images and creating a spritesheet, I wrote a simple random map grid creation class. It uses deterministic random procedurally-generated terrain (a seeded mersenne twister PRNG) so that a complex map can be recalled with a single integer seed value (no need to save a huge array to disk/cookie/localstorage). I then add extra water tiles around the edges by varying the shoreline randomly. \r<br/>\r<br/>Finally, I scatter hamlets, towns, cities, forts and castles in non-blocked tiles and give them random location names by combining two syllables from an array of three-letter strings. \r<br/>\r<br/>This results in a fantasy book-style map with scattered forests, mountains, hills, swamps, and deserts that hold a plethora of interesting-sounding locations.\r<br/>\r<br/>Finally, I implemented an A-Star pathfinding algorithm that can navigate a character around obstacles to get to any waypoint on the map (the green and red dots: green is how far you will move in a single turn before running out of &quot;energy&quot;). \r<br/>\r<br/>I also coded a line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm for use in the combat, which means that eventually projectiles and magic spells could be cast in a straight line but would be blocked by mountains or towns. The white dots are tiles that you are able to &quot;see&quot; - but in this version you control peace-loving bards with no attack skills.\r<br/>\r<br/>HOW TO PLAY:\r<br/>\r<br/>This game is more like CHESS or a puzzle game than a typical tactics title like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. \r<br/>\r<br/>Drag with the mouse button held down to scroll the map. You can zoom in and out with the + and - buttons.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you want to restart with a completely different random map, enter any number into the box in the top left and click the world button.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your green bards move very fast but die instantly if touched by a red army (unless you are really lucky). The red enemies move very slowly, but you are vastly outnumbered.\r<br/>\r<br/>Choose which army you want to control by clicking the buttons on the bottom in the middle. \r<br/>\r<br/>Click the location you want to move to and advance the turn (bottom left button) to start moving. \r<br/>\r<br/>You only get ONE order per turn, so choose wisely.\r<br/>\r<br/>ENJOY!\r<br/>\r<br/>Post Compo (JAM) edition: featuring enhanced terrain generation and new sprites for proper shorelines!",

He's a cell and birthdays are when cells evolve.\r<br/>\r<br/>I hit some technical snags with this one: My initial idea to use Photoshop and Flash and a map of 16,000 x 16,000 pixels caused me all sorts of headaches. Who'da thunk it? I succeeded at about 10,000 pixels square, but this ate out of my time I had hoped to spend making massive content. So the map is a little empty or MS-Painty in places and the game is silent except for the Tom 7 Special Title Screen Theme Song. But there is lots to do and I even just played through the whole game and it is winnable and I don't think you can even get stuck. You'll definitely learn a lot of accurate science on the way.\r<br/>\r<br/>http://evolution.spacebar.org/compo.shtml\r<br/>\r<br/>Hints, in increasing spoiler order:\r<br/> - I had also planned on a built-in map system, since the thing is pretty huge. The second screenshot is the map. Use it if you like.\r<br/> - If you're stuck after talking to the scientist, there's nothing else down there. You can get back out with a few well-timed rave jumps. This is the hardest part; take a look at the map.\r<br/> - First visit Gene, the shellfish.\r<br/> - The mine is flooded, to non-swimmers.\r<br/> - With new powers, tree climbing is indicated. No reason to take the long way from above.\r<br/> - The scientist detector is fooled by labcoats. That floaty thing is the way back out.\r<br/> - You can win up in space.

Not that the story got finished. It was worth a shot and I learned a good deal, such as: Next time the game is going to be randomly generated so I don't have to worry about making levels. Hope you enjoy whats there!\r<br/>\r<br/>Oh and by the way, if anyone read my post during the comp I didn't actually have a partner. Turned out he couldn't do it. So since I won't be able to work on it tomorrow anyway I may as well submit it now.\r<br/>\r<br/>P.S. Did you notice the spaces around the parenthesis up there? I guess I've been coding too long.\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: The web link is a zip download. I don't have anywhere to host the game, but it is in HTML5/JavaScript so you can just open it in Chrome, Firefox, or Opera (Not Safari). I wouldn't recommend Opera though, because it doesn't let you hold down an arrow key to move faster.",

And so did lots of other things...\r<br/>\r<br/>Nobody knows for sure, but one popular opinion states that people grew on trees.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your challenge is to outsmart evolution. Combine elements to grow trees, and evolve humans before 10,000 BC.\r<br/>\r<br/>Notes:\r<br/>\r<br/>Game play should be pretty self explanatory.

Throughout the game houses will build on the tiles around your Town Center and continue to sprawl outwards, provided you are a good and loyal mayor. Each special building has different effects for the tiles around it. \r<br/>As you play your city will either go bankrupt or go down in history as houses cover all areas of the map.  \r<br/>\r<br/>The world that you build in is new every time which allows for different outcomes with each new play through. The best way to enjoy Urban Sprawl is to play more than once. Continue playing and notice new trends and more efficient ways of building your city. You are the mayor after all and can't just leave the citizens of Jarlsberg to suffer.\r<br/>\r<br/>Urban Sprawl is written in HTML5 and will play right in your browser. The game is even optimized for decent play on most tablets and smart phones so give it a shot if you own one.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please let us know what you think of Urban Sprawl; we love to hear your comments and appreciate all feedback. We will most likely continue to work on the game which is accessible via http://thegamingproject.org\r<br/>\r<br/>The Gaming Project is proud of the Ludum Dare 24 game we created and with the closing of our second Jam entry we continue to look forward to future events.",

Please don't crucify me for that, or do and explain my error. \r<br/>The idea for this game was that you have these &quot;worms&quot; in a sort of tunnel system (looks more like a tree in the current version), who move at intersections based on their DNA. The yellow dots are energy (or something). Every new generation, is birthed from the last, favoring the DNA of those worms that collect the most energy (see that? Natural selection. I know these words). \r<br/>The players job was going to be to introduce the 3 mutations into the DNA, thus keeping the population diverse and guiding it to greater sources of energy. \r<br/>Although the point system is never touched in game, I'll explain the intention. Points would be awarded for the success of your population; however, less points would be awarded the longer the game went on. The player could spend points in order to mutate his population. The goal is to get as many points as possible, by making strategic mutations to the population. \r<br/>\r<br/>Buttons:\r<br/>Generate!: Interbreeds the current population to create a new population.\r<br/>Delete: nothing\r<br/>Invert: nothing\r<br/>Duplicate: nothing\r<br/>\r<br/>The two little squares around the map are anchors to scale the map.\r<br/>\r<br/>Keys\r<br/>W/S: Increases/Decreases the number of genes in the DNA \r<br/>D/A: Increases/Decreases the number of worms\r<br/>Q: Randomizes the population's DNA\r<br/>E: Creates a new map\r<br/>X/Z: Control the highlighted worm. \r<br/>\r<br/>P.S.

So as a player, you can either watch the simulation or, you can unleash disasters which can advantage some tribes and slow others.\r<br/>\r<br/>500 years was made using game maker 8.1.\r<br/>\r<br/>You may use/modify the source as you please.\r<br/>\r<br/>update :\r<br/> -&gt; modified the tiles.\r<br/> -&gt; randomized tiles.\r<br/> -&gt; disasters effects now vary depending on the profile of the tribe affected.\r<br/> -&gt; added pop messages when tribes reach a certain level in technology/warcraft/religion/politics\r<br/> -&gt; fixed the message boxes closing when pressing arrow keys problem.\r<br/> -&gt; added information on the main menu.\r<br/> -&gt; increased disaster radius.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>If you have any ideas let me know in the comments.\r<br/>I'll try to make a post-compo including as many new features.\r<br/>\r<br/>idea box :\r<br/>- when a tribe discovers a new technology, it will have an effect.\r<br/>- tribes can expand.\r<br/>- ressources can deplete.\r<br/>- you can spawn a monster and the tribes will unite to kill it.\r<br/>- sprites vary according to technology.\r<br/>- add mouse control.",

We liked the final result because the gameplay was very fun and frenetic, and the theme &quot;evolution&quot; was very present: evolve to survive. The survival of their species depends on how much you evolve. It was a fun work made by just two guys, that's it.\r<br/>\r<br/>To play Allel, use WASD to control the character and shoot everything that moves using the mouse button.\r<br/>\r<br/>* Cool graphics and animations;\r<br/>* Frenetic gameplay;\r<br/>* Balancing to play forever and ever;\r<br/>* Original soundtrack;\r<br/>\r<br/>Coming soon:\r<br/>\r<br/>* Autofire;\r<br/>* Leaderboard;\r<br/>\r<br/>Bugs:\r<br/>\r<br/>- Enemies &quot;recede&quot; and AI;\r<br/>- Character shoot after 5 evolutions;",

			"htmlDesc": "Well, here it is, my first LD entry ever. Unfortunately, since this is the weekend before university starts for me, I didn't have time to finish it. Using a language that I didn't have prior experience in (Haxe) didn't make things easier either. Unfinished also means that only about 10 enemies will spawn throughout the game (This may or may not be because spawning an enemy with a distinct movement pattern requires 5+ lines of code to set up the bezier curve...)\r<br/>\r<br/>Despite being unfinished and very buggy (especially when it comes to collision and sprites) I decided to submit it anyway.\r<br/>\r<br/>I used SFXR to create the sound effects and Autotracker-Bu to generate the music track.\r<br/>\r<br/>--------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Assimilation is a vertical scrolling shooter (Though no scrolling has been added yet...) with a twist. In order to power up your ship, you must absorb powers from enemies using special &quot;assimilators&quot; that you fire.\r<br/>\r<br/>In this unfinished version, there are three kinds of powers:\r<br/>* Assimilation (Enables you to fire assimilators, default power.)\r<br/>* Shield (You can put up a temporary shield around your ship. Note that this is pretty unreliable due to bugs...)\r<br/>* Bombs (Your ship can fire bombs which explode upon colliding with an enemy, damaging everthing inside a specific radius)\r<br/>\r<br/>If you assimilate the same enemy more than once, the associated power will level up, increasing its effectiveness. For example, bombs will have a larger radius and shields will last longer.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Move your ship with the mouse cursor.\r<br/>Press the left mouse button to shoot, hold to fire repeatedly.\r<br/>Press X to use the currently selected power.\r<br/>Scrolling up or down changes the current power.\r<br/>\r<br/>(NOTE: Since I was forced to stop the coding process abruptly, I didn't have time to set up a fancy page for the SWF. I therefore decided to add it as an ordinary download link as well, since the web version doesn't show loading progress.)",

The Blob will glow and make a noise when you're close enough to eat enemies. If an enemy sees you, then you need to get into cover before they shoot you.

If the JS binding to Android and iPhone works out well, I think this might be the best way to make cross-platform games in the near future.\r<br/>\r<br/>My third goal was to incorporate music in a cool way. I wanted the player to make choices that determined the music and changed the play environment. That didn't happen due to my JS skills being so-so and my 1yo girl being too cute to ignore all weekend :)\r<br/>\r<br/>I really wanted this to be playable on iPad, but my iPad2 is having performace issues. May be okay on iPad3, not sure.\r<br/>\r<br/>ART: I can't draw, but spent too much of my time trying :)",

			"htmlDesc": "Sorry for this essay I wrote here, just skip straight to the Controls bit if you're not a text person\r<br/>\r<br/>This is Dr. Helix, my first ever LD entry, it started out as an action/research game, but time constraints &amp; technical issues I moved it back towards a slightly more traditional top-down shooter mechanic.  I have tried to keep it a little different though, you have some gadgets...\r<br/>\r<br/>The main gadget is a DNA-changing gun, and almost all of the things in the game can be turned into something else (platforms, barriers, powerups, creatures etc).  You can also teleport a short distance, which works well with changing enemies into platforms.  You have a normal gun too, so I tried to put stuff in that used both mechanics, like when you hit a miniature death-mouse with the DNA-gun, then it evolves into a giant spider. Bad right? BUT, if you shoot the crap out of a giant spider you get an ammo top-up, and there's loads of death-mice running about that you need to shoot the crap out of.  So that's what I was aiming for.\r<br/>\r<br/>Overall I'm really pleased with everything, except maybe that it didn't relate to the theme as much as I'd have liked.  Oh and I also didn't get time to do music, which is a shame as I always enjoy making music.  Got some sound effects in there at least.  Also there may be a few clipping issues, but luckily you can teleport!\r<br/>\r<br/>Submitted as a .zip file with a standalone .exe inside, no installers or anything.  Thanks for playing, this is the first game I have ever finished and it has been a great experience\r<br/>\r<br/>*** CONTROLS ***\r<br/>W,A,S,D to Move &amp; Mouse to Aim\r<br/>Space to Switch Guns\r<br/>Left Mouse to Fire\r<br/>Right Mouse to Teleport\r<br/>\r<br/>*** HINTS &amp; TIPS ***\r<br/>\r<br/>~ Use the Right Mouse button to teleport, it's handy in a tight spot\r<br/>~ Shoot Flowers with the Genome Gun to get more DNA\r<br/>~ Don't kill the iSharks on the first level!\r<br/>~ Evolve the Cycloctopus into a Barrier for protection\r<br/>~ Evolve the Orbs of Certain Doom into a Turret to clear the enemies\r<br/>~ Evolve the Yellow Suppository Birds into Flowers\r<br/>~ Evolve the Death Mouse into Drunken Spider\r<br/>~ Kill the Death Mouse for Health\r<br/>~ Kill the Drunken Spider for Ammo\r<br/>~ Butterflies Evolve into iSharks when Near a Bridge\r<br/>\r<br/>So when it's hectic, evolve some barriers to hide behind, then evolve a Orb into a turret and lead enemies into the bullets.  There's a bit of tactical depth here, enough to get you tactical-ankles wet (well a bit wet)",

Sorry about this.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game is created with python 2.7 + pyglet 1.1.4, using OpenGL.\r<br/>Audio tools/instruments used were sfxr by DrPetter and Massive from Native Instruments, Renoise and Audacity.\r<br/>\r<br/>www.python.org\r<br/>www.pyglet.org\r<br/>drpetter.se\r<br/>native-instruments.com\r<br/>renoise.com\r<br/>audacity.sourceforge.net\r<br/>\r<br/>I had a lot of fun making this game and felt that everything went fairly smooth!  It's my most complete Ludum Dare to date for sure!\r<br/>\r<br/>It's not absolutely spotless though, there are lots of things that could be improved.  The code is very, very messy with gigantic classes, the rendering is done via immediate mode quite inefficiently, collisions do occasionally glitch. lack of content and so on.  Consider it a prototype.\r<br/>\r<br/>As a sort of weird little quirk, all graphics are generated in code.  I just didn't want to draw.  So there.\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope to maybe be able to clean this one up a bit and add some content - it is on very short side as I didn't bother to create a level editor and writing levels into lists is a pain :p  Hopefully it at least provides a feel of what it could be.\r<br/>\r<br/>Again, there might be an issue with performance.  I've only been able to test it on one system.  Let me know.\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyways, have fun and thanks!",

			"htmlDesc": "WASD or arrow keys, your pick. Mouse aim; left click to fire.\r<br/>W, UP, SPACE: Jump.\r<br/>Q, E, ENTER: Shift weapons.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game theme revolves around evolution, but in addition to that, enemies in the game are controlled by a massive genetic algorithm. All movement is selected at random and bred out as you succeed in killing them.\r<br/>\r<br/>That said, this game is, ideally, self-balancing. If you go out of your way to kill enemies, you ensure that they become stronger and stronger. If you run from them, you'll probably take a licking, but they won't get any less schizophrenic.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used:\r<br/>=================\r<br/>ENIGMA Development Environment: Windowing/Graphics/Controls/Compiler\r<br/>LateralGM: Visual resource organizer\r<br/>SFXR: Simple sound effects\r<br/>GIMP: All graphics\r<br/>\r<br/>Algorithm:\r<br/>=========================\r<br/>Enemies are equipped with a 24-protein DNA. Like ours, the DNA comprises a four-letter alphabet. Unlike ours, each letter represents an entire action, and I don't represent numerals in the same alphabet. At the beginning of the game, the behavior is generated randomly. That's why you see bugs jumping around acting all crazy-like, without really attacking. As enemies spawn, their genes are inherited from the original bug at that position, and from a second parent selected deliberately by virtue of &quot;merit.&quot;\r<br/>\r<br/>Merit is calculated by adding two factors. First, the time alive, in frames, wherein the enemy was within shooting range of you, and you had a clear shot of their exposed starting position. So if you are near a bug for 2 seconds, and fail to kill it (or just do not), the bug receives 60 points of merit.\r<br/>\r<br/>The other factor is the damage inflicted. For each point of damage dealt, the bug who dealt it receives 200 points of merit.\r<br/>\r<br/>Now, as for the genome. I preserved the letters &quot;A&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;G&quot; and &quot;C&quot; out of irony.\r<br/>\r<br/>A: Attack. Drop out of hiding and let 'em have it. If the ant/termite/whatever is underground, it will flail up and blast at you from mid-air. If the eye-bug-thing is hidden, it will appear and fire unceremoniously.\r<br/>\r<br/>T: Take Cover. The ant/termite/whatever will burrow under ground, the eye-bug-thing will vanish. If a &quot;T&quot; is encountered and the bug is already hiding, it will simply come out of hiding without attack (a genetic weakness).\r<br/>\r<br/>C: Charge. You'll see a small burst of yellow sparkles as the enemy's attack power increases. Only one shot will have this added attack power.\r<br/>\r<br/>G: Go move somewhere. Ostensibly the next four letters of the DNA will say where to move; in actuality, it's just an integer, because I'm lazy. Essentially, this is coupled with a signed byte. The ant/termite/whatever moves to a position that is right of his starting position by that value (so a negative number moves him left of it). The eye-bug-thing interprets the byte as a set of polar coordinates; a positive value denotes the distance from his starting point, and a negative value denotes the direction from it.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Story:\r<br/>=================================================\r<br/>Year 2512: Mutant bugs have overrun much of the earth.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Over the course of several hundred years, common insects have evolved to harness energy within them and expel it toward unsuspecting prey.  \r<br/>\r<br/>In an effort to combat them, human scientists constructed artificial versions of their weaponry with an internal power source.\r<br/>\r<br/>Despite the hightened potency of the human weapons, the insects were able to breed at a much higher rate than they could be erradicated. Eventually, the lab was overrun from the inside, and later from the outside. \r<br/>\r<br/>The bugs tore throgh nearly everything within the laboratory.\r<br/>\r<br/>While the research team is presumed dead, others hope that their findings can still be recovered. It is possible that given more time and with a better delivery mechanism, a gene therapy can be produced to reverse the effects of their evolution.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your mission is to recover any weapons and research that can be used against the bugs.\r<br/>=================================================\r<br/>\r<br/>You begin the game with nothing but the clothes on your back. There are three weapons to collect before you can beat the game.\r<br/>",

The levels were then unlocked in a varying order depending on the available upgrades - as you unlocked abilities the game unfolds in different ways. Sort of had an evolutionary feel to it, in a not-so-strict sense.\r<br/>\r<br/>Ultimately didn't have time to implement that, so I auto-unlock abilities as you progress. There's I think 5 proper levels, and 1 little end level for you to mess around in. No audio.\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyhow, enjoy! &lt;3\r<br/>\r<br/>-Nick, krangGAMES\r<br/>",

Made some concept arts and it turned out to be quite an awesome idea. I started to implement basic functionality and realized that this is going to be too big. After that I tried to simplify this as much as possible, and after that simplification it turned to quite poor game :(, basic idea is still awesome - sidescrolling RTS with dynamic environment - but this can't be done in this time. So the lesson of this story. Plan and reason more before furious coding.",

Each bit you pick up will evolve your craft - sometimes just a little, sometimes significantly.  Speed will increase, your firepower will increase, and your weapons may change.\r<br/>\r<br/>In normal mode, once you destroy the first Bit Empire Cruiser you will win the game.  If you change the setting to Hardcore, the game will go into an endless mode.\r<br/>\r<br/>Feel free to leave me comments here, on my blog, or on FB:\r<br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eyemobi/260949787353647\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks so much for playing :)",

Think of a comment to this pictire\r<br/>3. Play the game and rate (and/or put comment)\r<br/>4. Tweet/PM/mail/comment me that combo with tag/subject &quot;LD24CQ&quot; !!\r<br/>\r<br/>There is quite big possibility for that this pic will be ingame signed with your nick.\r<br/>\r<br/>How about that ? Huh ?:D\r<br/>\r<br/>======================================================\r<br/>\r<br/>I added post-compo version og my game. Before you rate please play at least correct one :)\r<br/>\r<br/>I am not taking any responsibility for possible keyboard damages! :D\r<br/>\r<br/>======================================================\r<br/>\r<br/>Your task is to hunt bugs in system. \r<br/>\r<br/>To compleate that task you have to rapidly press specific type of keys on your keyboard. Type is showed just below ingame computers keyboard. \r<br/>\r<br/>Keytypes are :\r<br/>  - Letters : A-Z\r<br/>  - Digits  : 0-9\r<br/>  - Specials : Everything else (F1-F12, Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Tab, Enter, Backspace, Arrows and symbols) but numpad\r<br/>\r<br/>You have to be carefull because if keyboard turns read that means the type of required keys can change. After that keyboard turns green.\r<br/>\r<br/>To compleate level you have to press specific amount proper keys in a row (streak). Required streak lenght is showed in top lefthand side screen corner.\r<br/>\r<br/>When you compleate all 3 levels you'll get reward. To play again you should reset levels from special menu.\r<br/>\r<br/>Levels differ amount of given time, lenght of streak, and a computer that you work on.\r<br/>\r<br/>In future i'll add other computers and inprove graphics, so stay tuned.\r<br/>\r<br/>Cheers :)\r<br/>",

			"htmlDesc": "The object of this game is to breed your bacteria to be more effective, and ultimately dominate the Petri dish by controlling at least 66% of its biomass.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game comes in two versions. The HTML5 version is preferred, but the Java fallback version has better performance and can be used if the HTML5 version is too slow. To use the Java version extract the ZIP file somewhere, and if on Windows, run one of the batch files appropriate to your screen resolution. On other platforms you will need to call the JAR file manually using commands similar to those found in the batch files. Getting music in the Java version requires a 32-bit JRE. If it is installed in the default location, the batch files should be able to find it.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game uses RTS style controls, with standard left click select and right click move. Press the middle mouse button to scroll around, or use the arrow keys.\r<br/>\r<br/>To breed a new bacteria, select one or more of your bacteria (your bacteria have a faint blue background and show up blue on the minimap) and press B. A new bacterium will be created at your cursor. The result will be a hybrid of all the ones you have selected. You can also just order a completely random one by pressing B with none selected. You will need to do this at the beginning to get started. You can only breed if your food is greater than zero.\r<br/>\r<br/>Pressing A with a bacterium selected sends it into &quot;aggressive mode&quot; where it will attack any nearby bacteria that do not belong to you. Ordering it to move automatically cancels this mode.\r<br/>\r<br/>The power of a piece of a bacterium is based on its size. The component types are:\r<br/>\r<br/>White - Structure, not special at all\r<br/>Gray - Weak Point, very easy to destroy but cheaper\r<br/>Green - Solar Cell, generates food for free when the dish isn't overcrowded\r<br/>Red - Weapon, deals damage on impact with an enemy\r<br/>Blue - Armor, much tougher than a normal component\r<br/>Yellow - Engine, used for movement",

The connection with the &quot;Evolution&quot; theme was supposed to be the graphics getting higher-resolution as you progress, representing the main character regaining his vision and sanity after a brain injury.  However, since I didn't make enough levels in time to do that (or write a story, or make anything but the most barebones art and the most barebones platforming mechanics because I spent most of my time getting the text thing to work), I just have it so the graphics upgrade every time you die on the graphical level, you can at least get an idea of what it would look like.\r<br/>\r<br/>Despite its degree of unfinished-ness, I submitted it anyway, because at least it's playable and somewhat challenging, and I'd hate to see all that work go to waste (after all, I did write a text-based platforming engine from scratch in 48 hours, and I think that's something to be proud of).  Originally, the game was going to be played on this very ratings page (the text would've transformed into a game window from whatever link you clicked on to start the game), but unfortunately, the submission form didn't allow me to do the Javascript shenanigans I needed for that to happen.  I might try a different method of that technique for a post-compo version, but it's unlikely I'll have the time.\r<br/>\r<br/>During the text portion:\r<br/>You are the letter O.  #s are platforms, and Xs kill you.\r<br/>During the Flash portion:\r<br/>This consists of only one level.  When you're done, you should see a blank screen.  Just exit out of the window to return to the ratings page.",

Sorry about that.\r<br/>\r<br/>I am a LOT more satisfied with this game than my first entry.  I was much more relaxed during the process, made better planning and time management decisions, and slept according to a planned schedule.  As a result I typed about twice as many lines of code as in LD23 and much less error-prone code.\r<br/>\r<br/>Everyone always asks if I'd like to continue a project after LD.  Its appealing in one sense -- I like the theme and mechanics of this game, but I'm appalled at how messy the code gets so quickly.  I think if I was ever going to &quot;build upon&quot; a LD entry it would be a rewrite.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks to my brother for testing and letting me use his windows laptop basically on demand.  And getting me stumptown coffee.\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy HumanTECH!!",

This Android game was inspired by the upcoming Hurricane Isaac, as our team is based in Louisiana.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your goal is to make a big friggen hurricane and slam it into the Gulf of Mexico.\r<br/>In yellow is your speed, in blue is your amount of water. As you gather more water, you get larger relative to the map. Hot air and cold air makes you get higher and lower, which lets you gain speed, lose water or lose speed, gain water.\r<br/>\r<br/>The white arrows manually adjust your course through the map. The blue and red arrows throughout the map are supposed to change your course and height.\r<br/>\r<br/>It takes a careful balance between water and speed to make a good hurricane. If you get too low to the ground, you'll gain too much water and crash into the water (aka break the game). Go too high, and you'll be ZOOMING FAST, but you won't have any water.\r<br/>\r<br/>HTML5 version coming soon.\r<br/>\r<br/>Credits:\r<br/>Lead Designer - Mitch Orcino\r<br/>Programmer/Designer - Kyle Bradshaw - @TehSkull\r<br/>Artist - Dae in Cho - @Haloflooder\r<br/>Musician - Seth White - @HerbivoreZombie",

			"htmlDesc": "A few things before I even get to TALK ABOUT the game...\r<br/>\r<br/>There's two versions. One is Flash, the other a standalone .exe for Windows. The reason for this is that the Flash version requires a pretty competent processor. I made the game on a dual-core desktop, and the Flash version lags HORRIBLY on it (it's okay on my i3 laptop, though). \r<br/>\r<br/>So if the Flash version is laggy for you, PLEASE play the standalone version instead. It is NOT fair to rate something you can't run properly, after all. Thank you.\r<br/>\r<br/>SECONDLY, if you're the kind of person who cares, despite being hosted there, the Flash version isn't eligible for the Kongregate competition, due to lack of integrated API. I know some people got a bit tetchy about playing Kong games since that whole 'thing' happened, so I dunno, this information might be useful.\r<br/>\r<br/>FINALLY! This game has fully voice-acted cutscenes that tell the story that is basically integral to the whole thing. They ARE skippable (via the 'Escape' key), but I'd really appreciate it if you'd watch them - You're judging, after all, and how can you judge content you've skipped?\r<br/>\r<br/>RIGHT!\r<br/>\r<br/>NOW ON TO THE GAME!\r<br/>\r<br/>You are Fred, a small, philosophical pink thing, doing the bidding of an ominous disembodied voice from above.\r<br/>\r<br/>Collect the green food things to add 10 points to your score, but be quick, because your score is dropping every second. \r<br/>\r<br/>Try and avoid getting hit. Every hit you take will cost you a whopping TWENTY points, which is a lot. And now you're thinking &quot;Wait, I CAN;T DIE?! Ahahaha! Where's the challenge in this?&quot; Well, bub, the 'challenge' is in getting a high score. FOR A REASON.\r<br/>\r<br/>There's a 'true' ending to the INCREDIBLY WELL-WRITTEN, VOICE-ACTED NARRATIVE that you'll only get to see if you can score more than 700 points overall. So y'know, put some effort in.\r<br/>\r<br/>Move with WASD, aim/shoot when you're able to with the mouse (hold the left button down to shoot continuously), skip cutscenes with 'Escape' but, like I said, please don't.\r<br/>\r<br/>That's everything, I think. If you encounter any bugs, grab me on Twitter (@dedhedzed) and I'll try and get them fixed as fast as I can. \r<br/>\r<br/>Phew!",

Had a ton of problems on the end trying to build it (first time using slick, and lwjgl applets ain't easy).\r<br/>\r<br/>You WILL need Java SE 7 installed to run the applet.

When you change level, that resets. I wanted to add a score based off of that, but didn't have time.\r<br/>\r<br/>But I finished something! If you look at the source and the resources, you will see that I had much more planned (one mob, background music, title screen, and so on...).

You would choose certain evolutions at points during that game that would give you new abilities (Invisibility, poison, ect.) and then you'd carry on until you died and got a highscore (How many heroes you killed).\r<br/>\r<br/>What it is:\r<br/>Right now it's a simple little game where you run around a one floor dungeon (Ladders don't work yet), opening doors and running away from an angry looking head. The dungeon works, the line of sight works, simple AI works, death works, and so does some other stuff. Oh and the dungeon is randomly generated (That took me the first 12 hours :D).\r<br/>\r<br/>What it isn't:\r<br/>A lot. I'm sure you can see what it isn't but I'm planning on finishing this game as I'm enjoying making it :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks for taking a look, comments are very welcome!\r<br/>Joseph Little.\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: Reuploaded with some changes to solve problems with XNA.",

Today that changes.  You are one teacher, but one of many, at your school so small.  You must traverse the hallways, scavenging what you can, to preserve the light of science in this school.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note: Some of the screenshots haven't updated yet - they're from my first shot at this.\r<br/>\r<br/>After much deliberation and a viewing of the Expendables 2, I decided on a different direction.  I had been focusing on the mechanics of evolution (natural selection, reproduction, adaptation) but I was getting nowhere.  I decided to mix it up.  Now, I am going with a game about Evolution - the teaching of evolution and the 'controversy' therein.\r<br/>\r<br/>GAME COMPLETE\r<br/>\r<br/>Known Bugs: \r<br/> - Sometimes pages spawn on top of a table, and can't be picked up.  May just have to deal with this one.\r<br/> - Collision detection with the environment is a little off.",

This is achieved by controlling the weather with tribal dances.\r<br/>\r<br/>You control two characters, one with WSAD and the other with the arrows. (If using both hands messes with your brain, like it does with me, you can also use the mouse to control them.)\r<br/>\r<br/>Move each character above a cloud stone in order to perform a rain dance. Same thing with the sun.\r<br/>\r<br/>Avoid the bears.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>// Edit: I put the game on Kongregate with one post-contest // update: you can now retry when losing on a level.\r<br/>// http://www.kongregate.com/games/Saturnyn/seedstory",

This means you can't consume the Blobs (this means no spawnpoints!).\r<br/>\r<br/>Hint: Winning the game with the starting Monkey is the highest difficulty.\r<br/>\r<br/>Game Framework: MelonJS ( HTML 5 / JavaScript )\r<br/>Tools: Paint.Net, Pickle, PyxelEdit, GarageBand, Audacity, Notepad++, Chrome\r<br/>\r<br/>Update: I added an Post Compo Version with Title screen, updated Soundtrack :), Pause Menu, Highscore and lots of bugfixes!",

Should work in any WebGL compatible browser.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Evergen is an evolving tower defense game.\r<br/>\r<br/>The object of the game is to build and evolve your network of energy as large as possible before the time runs out or you are overwhelmed by enemies. To start, click on the flickering energy node to expand your network, this costs 25 energy points. The game will generate a portion of the network that's powered by that energy node (which will now look like a glowing orb).\r<br/>\r<br/>The white enemies are attracted to these energy nodes and will immediately move towards them. If an energy node runs out of health points (indicated by the orb shrinking) it and the entire portion of the network that it powers will disappear forever.\r<br/>\r<br/>To protect these nodes, click on a hardpoint (a dark circle) which are spawned in various places along the network. This will create a defense turret (costing 5 energy points) which will target enemies and shoot them down. Turrets can also be relocated to another empty hardpoint, useful when a portion of the network is about to go down, you can save the turrets by moving them.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can press &quot;Space&quot; to reset the game, and you can &quot;Right Click&quot; and drag to pan the camera around.",

Attack other creatures to destroy them. Evolve your creature by taking the remains of your enemy. Red improves life, green improves speed and blue improves attack strength. Energy is currently unused (didn't have time to add the skill system).\r<br/>\r<br/>Press Escape to quit or restart the game. Press P to pause.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is programmed in Lua using the Love 0.8.0 game framework. Graphics were drawn with the Gimp. The in-game font is Victor-Pixel grabbed from http://www.dafont.com/victors-pixel-font.font. Sound effects were created with sfxr from http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html. I took inspiration from flOw http://interactive.usc.edu/projects/cloud/flowing/ and threw the progression system of an aRPG to the mix :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Update: uploaded a new .zip for Windows which should fix a crash from Love with certain ATI cards (this AFAIK https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=10104).\r<br/>\r<br/>Update (Aug 28): Fixed a bug where the game would sometimes crash when the player died.\r<br/>\r<br/>Linux users: running the Windows version through Wine works perfectly (although is a bit slow to start up). Otherwise download the .love file and run with Love 0.8.0 or later.\r<br/>",

Player 1 always was the braver one, he always willingly set for new adventures, as opposed to Player 2, more shy and reserved. Player 1 and 2 just finished their game, and Player 1 only wish for one thing : explore a new world! Player 2 isn't sure that's a good idea, and try to change Player 1's mind.

Maybe it's time for him to be the hero and go help Player 1...\r<br/>And that's how Player 2 will embark on a journey which will show him how much video games have changed throughout the years, not always for the best.

It fits into the theme of evolution in a way that I hope is different to other games in that it is the player that must evolve and not elements in the game. There is a very steep learning curve to playing this game. Not much help is given during play and the player is expected to work a lot of it out on their own, thus evolving. As keys used are similar to vim, it can also help the player to use vim better by creating muscle memory. JS/Linux and 32-bit binaries may not work perfectly. They have not been tested as much as the 64-bit version. If you want to compile the source yourself, you'll need to have the development files for ncurses and gcc. Important keys are: h,j,k,l to move, y to pick things up,  p to drop things or place them, b to see notepad, q to quit, o for OK and i for ordering supplies.",

In practice this may not turn out so well as many supporting features were not completed in time and there is unlikely to be a large enough layer base.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls\r<br/>--------\r<br/>* Left mouse: place/remove wire or paste selection\r<br/>* Right mouse: select/cut area\r<br/>* Ctrl+Left mouse: Cycle wire/electron head/electron tail\r<br/>* L: load last opponent's circuit\r<br/>* Ctrl+z: undo last change to circuit\r<br/>* Space: begin battle\r<br/>\r<br/>Inputs\r<br/>------\r<br/>On the left of the circuit are three inputs - three different distance sensors that insert electrons when the robots are a given distance apart (as a percentage of the arena width).\r<br/>\r<br/>Outputs\r<br/>-------\r<br/>There are five outputs on the right hand side of the circuit  that are continuously activated by receiving at least one electron every eight steps - three weapons and two movement controls. The three weapons are the Laser (which does the least damage), the Rocket (which also damages you if the opponent is too close) and the Claw (which can only attack at close range). If two weapons are active at the same time, each deals one half of its usual damage (one third if three are active). The remaining two outputs move your robot forward and back (for your robot, left and right on the battle display respectively).\r<br/>\r<br/>Battle display\r<br/>--------------\r<br/>The number in the top right represents your health and the top left your opponent's. The two boxes in the middle represent the relative spacing of the robots.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>If you are on windows you can run the windows executable version. Otherwise (on OS/X, Linux or Windows) you need love2d (https://love2d.org/) to run the love file.\r<br/>",

			"htmlDesc": "This is an educational game about the evolution of stars written in C# XNA where you play through the life cycle of a star and command the fundamental forces of nature to become a Neutron Star (as every star really wants to be a neutron star), aimed at the A-Level syllabus in the UK (16-18 yrs) I'm not technically a physicist so I used Wikipedia and http://www.astarmathsandphysics.com for research.\r<br/>\r<br/>If your not interested in the physics you may like the many pretty particle animations such as the ones for the Supernova or Black hole and they are to a certain degree physically accurate animations so you should hopefully learn something watching them too.\r<br/>\r<br/>Good look collecting all of the achievements! (the supernova, planetary nebula and black hole are the nicest animations  IMO so its worth trying to get to them.)\r<br/>\r<br/>GUIDE(SPOILER):\r<br/>--------------\r<br/>A lot of people are missing some of the content so here is the guide on how to get each animation:\r<br/>\r<br/>1) Planet. collect as little of the dust as possible try to right click a region with few large particles without attracting anything. \r<br/>\r<br/>2) Protostar. attract for about at least 2 secs to collect some dust and right click.\r<br/>\r<br/>How to win the Hydrogen fusing minigame: hold left click and fuse the ones which are close to each other first it might take a few tries but its not too hard once you got the hang of it.\r<br/>\r<br/>3) Brown dwarf. Lose the hydrogen fusing minigame.\r<br/>\r<br/>4) Sun -like star + Red giant win the hydrogen fusing minigame)\r<br/>\r<br/>5) Planetary Nebula + Whitedwarf. If you didn't collect too much dust in the first round (just more than enough to not get a planet) then after the red giant phase you will become a Planetary Nebula then a White Dwarf\r<br/>\r<br/>6) Supernova. if you collected a lot of dust in the first mini game ( collect for about 10-20 secs) then you get a Supernova after the red giant phase.\r<br/>\r<br/>7) After the supernova phase you get a strong force minigame where you must keep the proton and neutron apart (use two hands on the space bar alternating to click faster is what I find is the best way to beat this minigame). win it and you get a neutron star, lose it and you get a black hole.\r<br/>\r<br/>To run it you may need:\r<br/>-Direct X9\r<br/>-Latest version of the .NET Framework\r<br/>-The XNA redistributable\r<br/>\r<br/>Use this image if you need a clue to get some of the achievements.\r<br/>http://www.astarmathsandphysics.com/a_level_physics_notes/cosmology/a_level_physics_notes_cosmology_template_html_42d1285.gif",

The rules of reproduction have been tweaked to make the game more interesting and 'game-like' by preventing deadlock scenarios and making sure it's not too hard to get your cells to grow and expand.\r<br/>\r<br/>It has three game modes planned, two of which are implemented:\r<br/>\r<br/>  1.  Campaign - A set of puzzle levels where you face off against progressively more difficult enemy formations (unimplemented).\r<br/>  2.  Battle Royale - A bloody melee between four different teams of cellular automata. The grid is initialized with a random pattern, perfect for conflict!\r<br/>  3.  Sandbox - A blank slate for you to explore and test your own creations with up to four different teams.\r<br/>\r<br/>Try it out and let me know what you think!\r<br/>\r<br/>The official project page (including links to the source) for Conway's Revenge is here: http://nickknowlson.com/projects/conways-revenge/\r<br/>\r<br/>Check out my journal entries for the post-mortem.",

Upgrade various stats and try to beat the levels by selectively grabbing only the points you need, to upgrade the gear you need, and not upgrade the things that might hinder you.\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit:\r<br/> - re-zipped, should work on OSX now\r<br/> - the source now contains all there's needed to build run the game (except the JDK of course :P); \r<br/> - to run, import both projects into the workspace; NOTE: the entry point is actually in the main game project, not in the desktop one; the desktop one just holds some dependencies, sorry for the mess :P; The entry point should be: com.siegedog.minogear.apps: EntryPointWindows.main; and it should work on linux/OSX/whatever despite the name! :P (needs either jdk 1.7 or 1.6 but some refactoring!)\r<br/> - **notice**: requires JRE 1.6+; get it here from the official Java website: http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp\r<br/>\r<br/>Coded in Java, based on libgdx (nightlies 26.08).\r<br/>I used Eclipse as an IDE, Photoshop for the art.\r<br/>I have a tablet. No, it's not a Wacom - shut up, you there, in the back!\r<br/>Unlike other projects and LDs, I hardly did any sketching on paper.\r<br/>\r<br/>The following will maybe go (albeit in a more detailed fashion) in a postmortem, but here goes.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hello, so this is my (mostly unfinished) LD48 #24 entry. It's not even remotely done (sooo, many ideas left out due to lack of time) but I'm still happy. I'd like to say that I'm going to work on it some more (I really do, I had a blast so far), but I have no idea if time is going to be on my side. But we'll see.\r<br/>\r<br/>It still went *much* better than the previous ludum dares:\r<br/>- ld23: worked a lot on a buggy prototype that wasn't even remotely fun to play and gave up\r<br/>- ld22: tried a collaboration with a friend but we ended up spending most of our time fighting git and generally sucking at everything\r<br/>- ld21: skipped due to barbecue invitation with friends; t'was fun, though!\r<br/>- ld20: my first one - competed with game maker; I feel like I evolved a lot since then! A LOT! Although I still think this ld entry was the most complete one I ever made (well, its only competitor is this one, but still)!\r<br/>\r<br/>Well, happy hunting, people!\r<br/>Have fun making and playing games!",

The post-compo is a complete game.\r<br/>\r<br/>In Plinko Breeder, if your Plinko chip can't reach the goal, you have to employ selective breeding to obtain a chip that can.

Are you up for it? :)\r<br/>\r<br/>This latest post-compo version tries to incorporate all of the feedback recieved so far and has been completely revamped to (hopefully) not require any instruction. PLEASE post comments, though!\r<br/>\r<br/>If the game is too easy, try disabling natural selection under &quot;Advanced Breeding.&quot; Much respect to the breeders who &quot;get it&quot; and can disable stats. ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Features:\r<br/>Evolution!

The code is somewhat messy because I started panicking when time was running out.\r<br/>\r<br/>Why I made this:\r<br/>I was thinking about a game where it would be a top down robot shooter where you character would evolve into something bigger and has more guns. Then I decided you should maybe be in space flying from planet to planet getting things to prepare for a big planet where you get a device that basically lets you evolve into a dog and then it shows you 3 years before saying &quot;I wanna be a dog&quot; - the end\r<br/>\r<br/>But I realized it was stupid and I would've run out of time anyway. So I tried making a city building game where your city evolves as you defend it. There was supposed to be bosses and different enemy types and they would attack in waves but I ran out of time. You will find the extra images in the source. I also tried making workers go from place to place doing the jobs as enemies killed them with you defending. But I didn't have time to fix the bugs. There supposed to be a larger map too. Try imagining what it should've been like and then go play it and realize how bad it is. I may make a post compo version.\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS:\r<br/>Control - switch between fire and build mode\r<br/>Click - Place building/Shoot\r<br/>W/S forward and backward\r<br/>A/D turn robot when in build mode (in fire mode it follows your cursor)\r<br/>\r<br/>Other instructions:\r<br/>Shoot the other robots.\r<br/>There are three building types:\r<br/>Miner - gets stone to make more mines houses and farms\r<br/>Farm - makes food\r<br/>House - (you only need one of these, but you must have at least one) makes workers for every 5 food\r<br/>The only purpose of buildings is to increase score.",

In desperation, they assemble a ramshackle set of towers for their defense. Between every wave, they'll get a chance to improve on their towers by crafting them based on which towers did well during the previous onslaught. Slowly their towers become more powerful.\r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately for them, the dragons are adapting as well...\r<br/>\r<br/>Notes\r<br/>-----\r<br/>\r<br/>Thank you for checking out my game! Please forgive me for making a tower defense game, it was my first time and I though it might at least be interesting. The longest time spent was on the genetic algorithm code used to breed the dragons and craft the towers between each wave.\r<br/>\r<br/>The only thing left on my todo list, was to give the dragons some basic animation, and then a few more tower attributes such as a damage over time or sticky shots.\r<br/>",

I didn't have time to add proper sfx or music. Also the game lacks a bit of polish. More about this tomorrow with the Post Mortem.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game: As I have no knowledge about DNA, biology and so, I decided that given that Evolution took so long to be a Ludum Dare theme... what if Evolution itself fights against the previous LD themes? It has been in the final round 7 times and 9 voted, that's 9 levels!\r<br/>\r<br/>Every mini-level is inspired by one past LD theme, as can be seen on the top-left corner of the screen. Plus a last level surprise not inspired in any past them, but with which Evolution has got to fight til the last blood drop :)\r<br/>\r<br/>HOW TO PLAY: \r<br/>You have to collect a letter from the word EVOLUTION in each level. When the letter is picked up, a door opens to the next level. The first level can be tricky, but just think about finding the first letter. By the way, the game gets a little better after the first mini-level :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls: Sometimes cursors, sometimes mouse, sometimes both of them:)\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you enjoy it!\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE: Ok, looks like the first level is not so obvious so, as I want you pals to play the game, here's the trick: Place objects clicking around and hit the &quot;Boom&quot; button. Check the screenshot!\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE 2: Crap, it seems like there was some z-fighting issue with the &quot;Next&quot; button after winning the first scene! On my Intel card the button was shown in front of the dark plane, but on nvidia, it was rendered behind... Please check it again!",

I've tested it under current versions of Safari and Chrome, so if all else fails try one of them.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's also hideously unoptomized: The game should work on android/iOS, but loading levels will take 30+ seconds, and everything will be generally laggy.\r<br/>\r<br/>Libraries used: jQuery 1.8.0, Processing.js 1.4.1, messi.

			"htmlDesc": "Firefly\r<br/>\r<br/>It's a game about the core concept of evolution - selection. Your goal is to cultivate plants that survive longer than 5 minutes in a hazardous environment. Plants get pollinated by fireflys. Plants have a genetically coded resistance agains the environmental effects that surround them (heat, cold, rain). Try to kill all those fireflies that bring pollen that you don't want to have in your plants genetic code. Recombine those resistances that you want selectively to survive the dynamicly changing weather.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>TUTORIAL: There is an ingame tutorial that I added in the last second. It is not very intuitively written (although it does explain everything needed to play the game). I wrote an offline-tutorial that should explain much better. Of course you can also just start the game, but don't complain about not understanding what is going on afterwards please :) \r<br/>So here is the tutorial: http://timtips.com/ld24/tutorial/\r<br/>\r<br/>-------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Added android version. You can get it from google play by using the above link, using a QR-Scanner to scan the 2d bar code that is one of the screenshots attached further down this page (leads to google play too) or download the apk directly here: http://www.timtips.com/downloads/Firefly.apk. Not tested on smaller displays (eg. 480x320). Larger displays (up to 10&quot; tablet size) should work.\r<br/>\r<br/>The only control change is that you can swap between plant spots with a fling/pan gesture and instead of right clicking things, you can make a long press (keeping your finger on the same position for about a second).\r<br/>\r<br/>28.08.2012 Few people are still experiencing problems to start the game. Some thoughts: \r<br/>\r<br/>* Please let the game load, I didn't have the time to add a loading screen. It may take a couple of seconds until the black screen dissapears and the game starts. \r<br/>\r<br/>* If the applet version doesn't work for you, try the jar please. On windows double-click on it should be enough to start it. On linux just start it from console with java -jar filename.jar\r<br/>\r<br/>* If none of it is working, please consider sending me a stack trace to timtipgames@gmail.com or to leave a more detailed description in your comment. I would really like to make this game playable for everyone. Thanks :)\r<br/>\r<br/>* One user (Thurig) told me that only after disabling jar/zip-scanning in his antivirus software he was able to play the game. Be assured, its not because there is a virus in it :) So if you like, you may try that too.\r<br/>\r<br/>27.08.2012 EDIT: Fixed a bug that causes the game to crash on many windows PCs. Thanks for letting me know about the issue.\r<br/>\r<br/>The initial release and sources are still available timtips.com/Firefly.jar timtips.com/Firefly-src.zip \r<br/>\r<br/>The download links lead to fixed version+sources (No changes to game logic, just crash on startup-fixes)\r<br/>-------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>All graphics created with Inkscape.\r<br/>Music recorded from my KORG-SP250\r<br/>Effects by sfxr, ZynAddSubFX and Audacity\r<br/>Jura-Font by http://www.tenbytwenty.com/jura.php\r<br/>Engine: Libgdx\r<br/>Libs: The super awesome Artemis Entity System Framework http://gamadu.com/artemis/",

I think there's an interesting game in here somewhere, but it was way too ambitious for LD (let alone my first LD). As it stands it's barely a game: no win conditions, only one item, no sound, no level design to speak of.\r<br/>\r<br/>You play the only doctor in a city quarantined with the plague. You must try to eradicate it by distributing medicine, or at least survive until it dies out. As the infection spreads from person to person, it evolves. It may become more infectious, it may become more lethal. Each round starts off with the same strain but the evolution is chaotic and unpredictable. This makes the game insanely difficult at times and trivially easy at others. It's a really odd, frustrating game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Most importantly though, I had fun and learned a lot. I'll probably even keep working on it!",

Unfortunately, the second you walk through the door they all wake up, and start reproducing like crazy. Convenient that, isn't it...\r<br/>\r<br/>Kill them all as quickly as you can before they outnumber you. You attack by walking into them, they can attack you when they walk into you. Your health is the number in the top right, the max amount of damage you can do in one hit is the number below it and your speed is the number below that (all 3 are in green). Click on any slime and the same set of stats will appear in the same order for that slime (in red).\r<br/>The two blue numbers are to do with when you can upgrade. The top one is your total kills, the bottom one is your target. Whenever your total is above your target, click on one of your stats to upgrade it. Upgrading health will increase your max health by 5 and give you max health. Use your upgrades wisely, they become harder to get as the game goes on.\r<br/>\r<br/>Finally the two black numbers at the bottom are the current level (top), and the best level you've reached in this session.\r<br/>\r<br/>Sorry about the rubbish UI, I'm never very good at that stuff.\r<br/>\r<br/>A final warning, child slimes are often much more dangerous than their parents...\r<br/>\r<br/>(In retrospect, this needed a lot more balancing, but I still think it's fun! Level 20 is more or less peak difficulty for the record, though in theory it gets harder right up to level 150).",

I spent most of the time drawing animations which was exhausting but it paid off.\r<br/>\r<br/>You start as a young Darewin (e is on purpose!) and you get older as you progress through the game.

There are four bosses which you have to pass and in the end there's a little secret for all you game makers which I hope you'll understand. :P \r<br/>\r<br/>Thank you Ludum Dare community for your awesomeness and fun!\r<br/>\r<br/>*If it doesn't run, try downloading the jar, and running command &quot;java -jar LD24.jar&quot;.

Dude tries to find his way out and fights various obnoxious unicorns and fairies while trying not to be consumed by this inhospitable environment.\r<br/>\r<br/>The world is constantly in motion, as black-and-white (part of which is the protagonist) does its best to consolidate its efforts and gather up enough resources to defeat the vicious creatures of light. \r<br/>\r<br/>As Dude moves across the terrain, he slowly submerges in the flowers and grasses, so the player's task is to find sources of black and gray and munch them to develop some kind of resistance and eventually evolve into something bigger and stronger.",

No naval units, basically nothing past the &quot;ancient era&quot;, and even windows dialogue menus for selection (yes, I was THAT desperate for time).\r<br/>\r<br/>I wanted to add so much more... so please note that this isn't really a &quot;finished game&quot; but rather what I managed in 2 days.\r<br/>\r<br/>I spent 20 hours first day and 19 hours second day on this, and I'm wrecked.  If there's a serious bug you notice please post asap and I'll try to fix but I can't guarantee I will be able to anymore.\r<br/>\r<br/>Have controls.txt ready for reference, you'll probably need it - you definitely will if you have never played a civilization game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Made in Game Maker 8.1\r<br/>trivia: this game uses less than 25 colours.\r<br/>=================\r<br/>======EDIT1======\r<br/>=================\r<br/>I released bugfixed version 1(no gameplay changes except fixing broken content, no content added), and kept the original (since the patched version is after the deadline)\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, I uploaded a timelapse of me making it, for anyone interested (or those who don't believe I made it all in the 48h period):\r<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpyG4wB18Dg\r<br/>\r<br/>Bugfix list (bugfix release 1):\r<br/>-Fixed critical glitch with city going to -1 population from barbarian attacks, and causing errors with the power() function\r<br/>-Fixed critical glitch with being able to right click and select &quot;Move here&quot; with nothing selected, which caused cause errors\r<br/>-Fixed barbarian targeting - it was backwards, it was supposed to target civilian units before military ones\r<br/>-Fixed horse archer - after researching it, it wasnt listed in the city build menu sometimes\r<br/>-Fixed barbarian spawn rates (was glitched, always spawned, and too often)\r<br/>-Fixed F3 ending the turn, and F1 now correctly cycles turns fast.\r<br/>-Fixed barbarian healthbars appearing in fog of war\r<br/>-Unit select fixed, sometimes not selecting units\r<br/>-Barbarians fortify fixed- they stop moving when hp is less than max (so hp is restored)\r<br/>-A battle now correctly cancels a &quot;move to&quot; action\r<br/>-Cities now correctly make the last made unit, when done production\r<br/>-Horsearcher tech now correctly requires warrior tech\r<br/>-Years were incorrectly growing by 100 years/turn up until 3000AD, not 3000BC, which is fixed  (purely trivial counter but still)\r<br/>\r<br/>Known issues:\r<br/>-S settles a city, but is also the alternate down key.\r<br/>-When research finishes, the city doesn't update status to clarify that (but it does finish, it just says &quot;building research&quot; instead, indefinitely, which does nothing).\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT3:  List of features I managed to do in 48h:\r<br/>-Fully working (excluding the fixed glitches) 4X engine with unit movement (including a primitive move-to), health, battles.\r<br/>-Primitive barbarian AI and spawning, which wander until near a unit or city, and head towards it - they (should) attack defenseless units first, cities second, and military units third.\r<br/>-Cities: that can grow, produce units or technology, be depopulated or sacked by barbarians (won't disappear if it's the only city left)\r<br/>-Cities work tiles: you can change how they prioritise them with the city focus setting (default, food focus, production, max food, max production)\r<br/>-Fog of war/Unknown area fog fully working, with units making visible a radius of tiles around them\r<br/>-Select next unmoved unit (a bit buggy but yeah) - when done, a new unmoved unit is selected and the screen is centered on them, or you can press tab to go to the next unit - better than clicking on them one by one for each move!\r<br/>-Greater visiblity on &quot;mountains&quot; (that lame rock thing), worse in &quot;forests&quot; (that lame tree thing)\r<br/>-Unit movement - each unit has a specific movement, and terrain affects it - mountains cost a lot of movement, rivers a lot too, roads are much faster\r<br/>-Improving tiles - workers can be built, that can build farms, roads, quarries, mines, plant or remove forests or clear improvements\r<br/>-Can create new cities with colonists.\r<br/>-Very little but still *some* unit variety (A weak Conscript, a moderate Warrior, a moderate but fast Horse-archer, against your standard Barbarian)\r<br/>-Units affected by terrain (stronger if on a mountain or river, weaker in desert or tundra if I remember my code correctly)\r<br/>-Healthbars, but the bugfix release may have broken them altogether.\r<br/>-Save/load (F2 to save, F3 to load, F5 quicksave, F6 quickload)\r<br/>-Basic text UI, but it should suffice.",

Finally, the two buttons on the far right let you show the temperature or water heatmap.\r<br/>\r<br/>You gain eggs as creatures are surviving and reproducing on the map. So, having mice breeding and living happily would create mice eggs.\r<br/>The first tier of creatures (eggs on the left) feed on their favorite terrain. The next tiers eat the lower level.

The purpose of this game is not to be won. The purpose of this game is to get progressively better at killing you.\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: Because the levels of this game are born in the cloud, this game will necessarily continue to change after the 48 hour Ludum Dare period completes.

Nothing else was changed. The Windows and Linux versions were added after the 48-hour deadline and also incorporate these changes.

Plus I probably didn't make it in the neatest of ways. It's super buggy and doesn't have an actual goal due to time constraints or any threats which were all planned by did not make it into the final game. I also didn't get the time to record or add in sound effects which really annoys me as I always aim to get something in.\r<br/>\r<br/>I made it in Game Maker HTML5 although early in development it decided that the game wasn't going to run in HTML5 so I decided to just go for Windows instead of waste lots of time.

You should play that one! If you want to rate based on what we had by the deadline, that version's available too. :)\r<br/>\r<br/>The website is much improved too, check it out: http://www.yonispants.com/DGP\r<br/>\r<br/>-------\r<br/>\r<br/>Space, the year 2014. DGP Space Lion arrived at planet Shetty following a report on a stolen vehicle. Minutes after arriving, he realized his spacepolice car was missing, most likely stolen by one of the local low-lifes. Stranded on a foreign world, he must now search the entire planet for his ride and get back home, to file a report. It's a dangerous world out there, filled with Gnorlms and Knarxals, known to be highly adaptable to any kind of weapon used against them. May the gods have mercy on their souls.\r<br/>\r<br/>The enemies evolve quickly, and before long they will resist all your attacks! Try alternating weapons to beat your opponents.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game and its absolutely accurate physics were inspired by Bollywood cinema.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Arrow keys - move\r<br/>A - punch\r<br/>S - kick\r<br/>D - use weapon\r<br/>Q - next weapon\r<br/>E - previous weapon\r<br/>F - toggle fullscreen\r<br/>\r<br/>If you find the game too hard, enter the cheat code LION to get 99 lives, full health, all weapons and type a digit between 1 and 8 to skip to that level.\r<br/>\r<br/>NEW! Updated website - the game soundtrack is now available for download!\r<br/>\r<br/>CREDITS:\r<br/>\r<br/>Yoni Rozenshein - Programming\r<br/>Hagay Giller - Graphics\r<br/>Lihi Karni - Animation, Additional Voices\r<br/>Asaf Sagi - Voices, Assistant Animator, Dishes\r<br/>Aviad Shamir - Story, Dialogue, Sound Effects, Additional Voices, Additional Dishes\r<br/>Gal Raviv - Music, Additional Animation, Additional Voices\r<br/>Uri Shomroni - Level Design, Additional Writing, Additional Animation, Additional Graphics, Dance Sequence, Additional Additions\r<br/>Ido Cohen - Pizza, Beta Testing\r<br/>Simon Shocket - Theme Song Vocalist, Additional Voices\r<br/>",

Please take that into consideration.\r<br/>\r<br/>The 'evolution' part of this entry is that the screen size evolves. My original idea was to have basic graphics in the first level, a basic soundtrack and basic other stuff, and it slowly gets upgraded or 'evolves' throughout the game. That idea was rapidly thwarted as I realised I was about as skilled a banana-wielding hamster at art, so I kept to the basic graphics.\r<br/>\r<br/>I then went on to think how I could make it involve evolution, so I thought I could do each level as a stage of development, or evolution, but I quickly realised that I was too far into the game to start taking multiple steps backwards.\r<br/>\r<br/>I eventually came up with the idea of having the size of the game evolve, as you completed levels, and I stuck with that.\r<br/>\r<br/>I have given this game a thorough testing by my brother and mum, who didn't get past the first level (there are three &gt;:D).\r<br/>\r<br/>Thank you for playing and I congratulate you with the highest of congratulationosity if you complete the third level.\r<br/>\r<br/>Update!!\r<br/>THE IDEA IS TO SHOOT THE OTHER COLOURED PIXELS, PRESS THE INFO BUTTON ON THE MAIN MENU TO FIND OUT THE CONTROLS!\r<br/>\r<br/>Update 2!!\r<br/>EACH LEVEL LASTS 2 MINUTES, THE FIRST LEVEL, AN ENEMY SPAWNS EVERY 20 TICKS.

Requires Java 7\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls: Arrow Keys - Move, Z - Attack, X - Absorb. \r<br/>\r<br/>This is an arcade style survival game. The goal is to stay alive as long as possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tribes of ink soldiers are fighting for control of a piece of paper. Each tribe has genetic traits that dictate its base attack power, defense power, speed, regeneration rate, and upgrade rate. So some tribes are innately better than others. \r<br/>\r<br/>You are an ink soldier like any other, with one additional ability. You have the ability to absorb the ink dropped from fallen ink soldiers around you. To do so, be over the corpse of a slain ink soldier and hold X. This ink makes up your gene pool, which is shown as a bar at the bottom of the screen. Each tribe has its own unique color of ink, and your gene pool is comprised of the colors of ink you have absorbed. The dominant color in your gene pool dictates what your genetic traits are, so you can join different tribes by absorbing the ink of their fallen soldiers.\r<br/>\r<br/>Ink soldiers come in four classes:\r<br/>Each soldier class can upgrade into the next one by killing enemies or being near\r<br/>allies killing enemies.\r<br/>Spear - These are the basic soldiers, and have a thrusting attack.\r<br/>Sword - Melee soldiers with a cleaving sword slash attack.\r<br/>Bow - Ranged soldiers that can shoot arrows from a distance.\r<br/>Cannon - The ultimate soldier. Has a powerful ink cannonball attack.\r<br/>\r<br/>The only goal of this game is to stay alive for as long as possible. The score is the number of seconds you've stayed alive. New tribes get stronger over time, so you will eventually need to switch tribes in order to be on par with other soldiers. Whenever you manage to switch tribes, you will lose all of your class upgrades, and your absorption power will also become less effective.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tips:\r<br/>- Ink soldiers in your current tribe will be striped to make them stand out more.\r<br/>- Try to observe tribes fighting each other to figure out who the stronger tribes are. \r<br/>- Stick with your tribe to stay safe, but be ready to convert into a genetically superior tribe in case your current one becomes overwhelmed! You will want to upgrade into the cannon soldier as quickly as possible to have a fighting chance against stronger tribes. \r<br/>- Tribes will roam the map randomly. Try to avoid getting mobbed by really fast enemies.\r<br/>- The more of your gene pool is comprised of the dominant color, the stronger your attack multiplier will be. Absorbing ink from fallen allies is a safe way to increase your damage.",

For instructions on how to play, see ingame help. Playing requires a mouse.\r<br/>\r<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br/>UPDATE 2012-08-29, by popular demand/criticism:\r<br/>Here's a longer and probably complete explanation of what's going on. This has been added AFTER the deadline, so if you want to be as confused as the first testers were, please stop reading at this line!\r<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS\r<br/>Everything is mouse-only. LMB+Drag moves the map, RMB+left/right-drag rotates, LMB+RMB+Up/down-drag zooms. For convenience, arrow keys scroll as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>BLOCKS\r<br/>To select a block, click it. The right menu changes from the Main Menu to the Block Menu. At the top, there's a representation of what's currently on this block. Click a building icon to see its stats below. If you need the space, you can order it torn down there (returning 60% of the cost). Click an empty building slot to open the build menu.\r<br/>\r<br/>BUILDING\r<br/>Buildings are grouped by their main attributes into 5 categories: Education, Luxury, Housing, Industrial and &quot;special&quot;. There is one special building for each category. These can only be built when the block is completely empty, the block is suited for it (shown by colored floor) and they have really high requirements.\r<br/>\r<br/>ECONOMY\r<br/>On &quot;Next round&quot; (or 10 times a second on Autoplay), every block is affected by those in a range around it and it's new state is computed. Housing (obviously) provides living space for the population. Industry generates money, but also Pollution. Pollution makes people want to move away. The same goes for overpopulation (i.e. after demolishing an appartment tower). Luxury does the opposite, it attracts people. As a bonus, the Park also decreases Pollution. Educational facilities add to the global Education Level of the city. The Education Level determines which advanced buildings can be constructed - most builings require it, and all Special buildings require very high education levels in addition to their price.\r<br/>\r<br/>ACRONYMS\r<br/>We really like them! They look oldschool!\r<br/>PPL: Population\r<br/>RND: Round counter (the ingame date)\r<br/>MON: Money\r<br/>EDU: Education\r<br/>IND: industry (generates money)\r<br/>SPA: Living Space (how many people fit in that area)\r<br/>POL: Pollution (the bad side effect of industry)\r<br/>LUX: Luxury (keeps people happy)\r<br/>RNG: Range (how many blocks affects this)\r<br/>LPB: how much effect is lost per unit distance\r<br/>",

I didn't write a journal this time, mainly because it was my first year, and secondly because I didn't do a thing in the first 24 hours and I scrambled to finish in the 24 I had left.So, in conclusion, I hope you enjoy the game!\r<br/>\r<br/>edit: I have added music using an old program I once found. I also removed a thorn bush that takes you to the last level (used for my testing purposes) and the source code has been modified to mirror that\r<br/>\r<br/>edit 2: a critical error with the last evolution of the blue organisms forced me to add a new object. I think that this will be the last update",

			"htmlDesc": "GONADS is our take on the theme:  blind, undirected evolution fueled only by death and the sexual impulses of 21952 different robots.  Unfortunately, that was too many robots and we never quite realized our goal of actually making a win/lose condition or progression on the character's side.  So what we have left is more of a toy than a game; more of a preview of our generated robots.   We have art for about 9 times as many chassis as you can see in the game, in addition to a large number of traps and things the robots could do to counter the traps.  All the artwork was originally produced since the beginning of the jam.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game would have worked as such:  You are an employee in a lab who's robots suddenly go haywire, forcing you to protect various important assets.  You can place barricades and traps, but the robots are varied and diverse, and among their ranks are robots built perfectly to compromise your defenses.  The better the individual robots do, the more likely their GONADS (galvanized ontogenetic nanobot assembled deployment systems) are to transmit their own designs back to the manufactury, guaranteeing more similar robots.  The goal of the player, therefore, is to misdirect this reaction.  Build walls and walls of wood until every robot carries a saw and an axe, then switch to metal bars and sprinkler traps and watch as they fall against your defenses... until the one nerdy robot carrying an umbrella and an arc welder makes it to the front of the pack, impressing all of the lady robots,* spreading his seed far and wide.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is more of a general proof of concept for the pathfinding that that game would use.  You can place blocks from the panel in the upper left that add to the 'cost' of the path based on the hardness of the block (wood&lt;stone&lt;metal), and robots will re-path mid route, even to other goals.\r<br/>\r<br/>We (just two of us) do plan on fleshing out this concept in the coming weeks.  Check out http://madleedesign.com/ for updates as we release a finished version in the next month.\r<br/>\r<br/>*(There are not actually lady robots)  ",

I attempted to design the stages to let you go just a bit further with each aircraft until you ultimately win. :) \r<br/>\r<br/>I had fun with the idea of evolving gameplay as a parallel to the evolution of aviation itself. In our modern day, it's easy to take the security and comfort of modern airplanes for granted--like how the WASD controls and overwhelming firepower for a shoot'em up has become pretty much standard. So I attempted to hark back to humble beginnings to show the limitations and frustrations of earlier aircraft and how aviation became what it is now. \r<br/>\r<br/>Oh, and there's a boss at the end somewhere. \r<br/>\r<br/>[Tip: To dodge the double attack, I've been going right then left (or vice versa depending on his position), cutting between bullets with the glider.

To have an easier beggining press the sun in the menu to get +2000 life essence on the start. Then make surve to evolve into a fish, as it makes the game more easy, although the regeneration rate at the same beggining gonna be a little slow.\r<br/>\r<br/>To gather life essence swim into an enemy organism that looks weaker than you. Then you'll notice damage turn's info popping out about how much damage you and your enemy dealed. If the enemy damage looks higher it's probably wiser to try to avoid him for some time.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can avoid some of the damage by quickly attacking some enemies at once. Damage turn restarts every 0.5 second on every creature, this means that after getting hit you can still hit another creature without you getting harmed.\r<br/>\r<br/>After the evolution the best way is to upgrade damage one time first, as your base damage is pretty low. Then the best pick would be to upgrade life and armor. The size upgrade is giving you the most advantage later on for a really low price of 100LE each, and it helps out a lot in hitting multiple organism at once, thus lowering your total damage that you receive.\r<br/>\r<br/>#####Handbook:#####\r<br/>\r<br/>Upgrades:\r<br/>\r<br/>Speed        - Max spd +20, costs 100LE +25LE per spd level.\r<br/>\r<br/>Acceleration - Max acc +20, max spd +5, costs 100LE +25LE per acc level.\r<br/>\r<br/>Armor        - Max arm +1, max life +5, armor regen +0.01, costs 125LE + 25LE per armor level.\r<br/>\r<br/>Danger       - Level +2, power* +10, leadership** +1, costs 200LE + 50LE per dng level.\r<br/>\r<br/>Damage       - Power +20, costs 150LE + 25LE per dmg level.\r<br/>\r<br/>Size         - Size + 2.25% base size, max life +5, power +2, costs 100LE.\r<br/>\r<br/>Life         - Max life+20, life regen +0.2, costs 150LE + 25LE per life level.\r<br/>\r<br/>Form         - gives you a new form.

Until you were activated with a mysterious radiowave transmission from deep space.\r<br/>\r<br/>Now, it is up to you to discover the fate of the Resistance, the meaning behind your activation, and the shattering secrets hidden in the fabrics woven by time!\r<br/>--------\r<br/>\r<br/>INSTRUCTIONS:\r<br/>\r<br/>Up, Down, Left, Right to move.\r<br/>X to shoot.\r<br/>Z to jump.\r<br/>C to see which keys you currently possess.\r<br/>Hold Shift to dash.\r<br/>Hold X until you are glowing to unleash a charged shot.\r<br/>Shift+Z+Direction to open a door for which you have the key.\r<br/>\r<br/>--------\r<br/>\r<br/>This game took about 30 hours of total nonstop work to complete. I put a damn lot of effort into it, so please take the time to download and score it. Additionally, please be gentle with the criticism, this is only my second game and I'm 14. Thank you, and enjoy.\r<br/>\r<br/>--------\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, check out N247's awesome game, http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&amp;uid=7563\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT:\r<br/>Apparently the movement isn't too great. I thought it was good, but hey. If it's the speed of the movement that's bothersome, just hold shift to dash everywhere.\r<br/>\r<br/>~Kortuga",

Luckily for me, Twine was an utter breeze to use and learn, and I honestly think everyone should give it a shot, if only as a small experiment: http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/ .\r<br/>\r<br/>2052 itself is an interactive story told from the perspective of Karen Lewis, a journalist living in a dystopian society where the rich have grown their businesses beyond sane limits. These megacorporations have evolved to the point where they control almost all facets of modern society - and crush all their opposition, leaving the society below them to stagnate.\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm proud of having made this, for not only making it in 16 of the 48 hours but also that I've created a project as complete as I intended it to be from the start.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please, share any comments and criticism! I'd love to hear how you'd improve it! :)\r<br/>\r<br/>TO PLAY\r<br/>----------------------------------------\r<br/>Simply read the story, click the links embedded in the text for more information and guide the character through the story.

It's up to you, you can cross the ocean big or small. You might have to adapt to the environment, after all this is Evolution.\r<br/>\r<br/>It was made with Lua and LOVE.

Just download the .LOVE and run it with &quot;love angryfish.love&quot; on the terminal. For this, you need LOVE installed.

Its color should change as the genetics values change.\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal is to reach the same evolution as the second cell using combination of radiations. You can check the percentage of Genetic Match by clicking the button next to the second cell. Red is under 90%, Green is over. \r<br/>When the Match is tested and return a positive answer, two new cells are generated.\r<br/>\r<br/>For Mac and Win, and I'm working on Linux support.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've used C++ and the GLFW openGL library.

From catching rain drops, to tossing balls around. Paddle changes from one form to different forms depending on its environment. \r<br/>\r<br/>This is also an experiment of using minimal(no) text to express what one needs to do, by using generic games I am sure it will be easy for gamers to pick and play this game. Although I feel this will alienate non-gamers, this is a safe compromise though because the audience who play these games don't fall into the latter category. \r<br/>\r<br/>Just a heads up to everyone the keyboards directional keys (up, down, left, right) are the only buttons that will work with this game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used are Visual C++ 2010, OpenGL, GLUT, GLEW, DevIL, and BFSX. DevIL is only included because i thought i was going to add images but I decided not to. ",

Here's what the game's all about:\r<br/>\r<br/>Separated by the one you love, you must transform the world around you in this laid-back platformer in order to complete your mission.\r<br/>\r<br/>As an added challenge, try and get all 5 hidden stars in the game.  (Eventually this will be used for achievements on sites.)\r<br/>\r<br/>Note: I used the engine I made in my &quot;I'm in&quot; post to get a heads start on scene rendering and platform physics.  Other than that, all 1000+ lines of code were written within time. :)\r<br/>\r<br/>I will have a timelapse ready in a few days.  Since it usually takes longer to make the timelapse than it is to record it, I'll just post a link as a new post.  :)\r<br/>\r<br/>How does this game relate to &quot;evolution?&quot;  Well the world literally evolves, and enables you to progress in the game.  I felt that doing a game where the player evolves is too expected.  I feel like I've accomplished my goal of being unique!\r<br/>\r<br/>Thank you so much for playing, and I wish everyone good luck on your ratings!  I really love Ludum Dare! :D\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>****Update at 2 hours, 18 minutes remaining: Added quality option and fixed score counter****\r<br/>****Post-compo version has a new game mode if you get all of the stars!***",

The theme evolution had a great impact on the original design, but i had to chop up the game so much due to the time constraints, which is reflected in the game - its short. The theme is however still present, but not really as originally intended. \r<br/>\r<br/>The dialogue itself was thrown in &quot;on the fly&quot;, and i almost need to contain myself in order to not go in and edit, or rewrite the script!\r<br/>\r<br/>But here it is! After ~15 hours of work clocked in, its at least playable from start to end, and you get to experience some cool mechanics!\r<br/>\r<br/>It has been a blast, and i had a lot of fun doing it. Hope you'll have some fun playing it!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Do note:\r<br/>- The windows version of the game does not support some WebGL features. Thus, it is advised to play it in Chrome (Web).\r<br/>\r<br/>- When the screen suddenly goes black, you have reached the end of the game. The last part was done during the few last hours before the deadline so, my apologies for that!\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>- Move with arrow keys. \r<br/>- Hold space to stop time (when near an object or another pixel)\r<br/>- Press space mulitple times to shoot (when available)",

The player is an adventurer, attempting to climb the Tower of Babble, solving riddles along the way posed by its guardian, whose use of the language evolves with every floor.\r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately, the game is unfinished right now, though a lot more work has gone into it than it appears - various additional graphics have been drawn and features coded, but aren't in a suitable state to be released right now. I submitted the game in this state since I'm proud of what we've managed in our first time working as a team (especially since we started quite late). Due to other commitments plans for an immediate post-jam version have been cancelled, but I intend to go back to this and past LD projects in some form or other.\r<br/>\r<br/>Coding and concept by shockedfrog\r<br/>Graphics by aprilia_moon\r<br/>Music by SergeAn (not created during LD time)",

Specifically, get AutoHotkey_L.\r<br/>\r<br/>Speaking of the source, I'd recommend protective eyewear before gazing upon it. It's quite messy and might be giving off low levels of radiation.

It's an unfinished piece of sh*t, it's not worth your time.\r<br/>\r<br/>Basically, I tried to make a game as a sort of simulator/strategy/sandbox thing with the main goal of evolving life on a planet and then developing it's technology. Every evolvement process (both technological and organic) is scripted and the gameplay consists of influencing the process in some way. \r<br/>\r<br/>In the end, I failed and managed to finish only evolutionary process, meaning I've scrapped technological advancement part and conflicts between different species. I've also left behind some more stuff from original concept, such as life transfer between planets.\r<br/>\r<br/>The version you see here is shameful to call an alpha even. It's unfinished and there's actually no reason for uploading it here. There's a slight consolation in this being my first actual game project and a game jam, also my first *real* experience with Unity besides testing. I guess it's something.\r<br/>\r<br/>I will try to finish this in the following days so that the game will be more of a &quot;game&quot; rather than a test.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note: There are other types of planets with other basic conditions in game code, including gas giants and ocean planets. I will add random planet generation in forthcoming updates so that they will be available too.\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT 1: Added web version, added 28.8_Data folder to windows build.\r<br/>EDIT 2: Fixed some bugs, added a note about game's state, working status messages. Since contest rules permit only small fixes, this version is a 'final' contest one (unless there will be bugs, which I'll fix).

Success means progress, but are you able to keep up with the evolution? :)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>INSTRUCTIONS\r<br/>\r<br/>-Use the arrows to move and X to jump. The other commands are presented as you have access to them. Just try to get to the end of the levels, and you'll make progress in uncovering the evolution monolith!\r<br/>\r<br/>-All the levels are proceduraly generated on the fly, so you never play the same level twice\r<br/>\r<br/>-The objective is to go as far as you can, and let us know where you stopped! :D\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>This is our 2nd time in Ludum Dare. We challenged ourselves pretty hard on the tech side this time (much more than we planned).\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you enjoy!\r<br/>\r<br/>Pixel Cows is a totally-not-famous indie dev team made of two guys from Brazil. I usually handle design and production, and Joao Pedro (NecroToad) makes the tech magic. Singularity's protagonist and overall design is vaguely based on &quot;The Journey of Eko&quot;, our main project (see more at www.pixelcows.com). \r<br/>\r<br/>Special thanks to Dan Filimon for last minute graphics, Kevin MacLeod at incompetech.com for the great free music, and to our supportive family and friends - you guys are just GREAT! :)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>PS: I fixed a game breaking bug that led to game crash, freeze or severe level unbalancing. There are no new features whatsoever, but there IS a new 'difficulty' counter at the upper, righthand part of the screen. It serves no purpose in game, but help you, fellow Ludum Dare judge, to let me know how far you got!",

Suddenly, hungry flies appear to eat it, but  they are smart and can quickly evolve and learn how to escape from the bubbles. It's up to you to blow them up before they eat all your yummy cake.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>## Controls\r<br/>\r<br/>- Mouse Move: Move bubble gun towards the flies\r<br/>- Left Mouse Click: Fire\r<br/>- Right Mouse Click: Explode\r<br/>\r<br/>## Development Notes\r<br/>\r<br/>My intention was to place a kitchen window as background image and to place a cake by the windowsill, so the flies could come through the window and eat the cake, as the name of the game says. However, the short time would not let me do it.\r<br/>\r<br/>I took the theme to the letter and the evolution is in the behavior of the flies, i.e. their behavior evolves as the time passes by.\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: Google Chrome or Firefox is strongly recommended!\r<br/>\r<br/>## Contact\r<br/>\r<br/>* Email: renato.ppontes at gmail dot com\r<br/>* Site: http://inf.ufrgs.br/~rppereira\r<br/>* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/renato.ppontes\r<br/>\r<br/>## Acknowledgements\r<br/>\r<br/>* Voice By Carolina Vidotto Pyramo &lt;3 (https://www.facebook.com/carolina.vidottopyramo)",

However you don't control Zacarias in his quest to Ultimate Butchery, you will control the level around him and aid him in his advancement.\r<br/>As Zacarias becomes more powerful, capable of a greater range of motions, your powers in the world will deminish, as Zacarias needs less help.\r<br/>The story of Evolution of a person, with the aid of others.\r<br/>Also, to show the real Evolution, we change the surrounding according to Zacarias' evolution.\r<br/>\r<br/>We are very happy with the result, but as always with something made with a short deadline, there is always that little feature.\r<br/>\r<br/>We were able, although, to create a level editor so that  you can create you levels and share them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you enjoy our game as much as we enjoyed making it.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note: the block on the bottom left corner represents the block you have selected to put, and on the right there are two blocks, which represent the moves (changes of level's blocks) you have left.

			"htmlDesc": "So ok. \r<br/>This is the entry of Nathan Mitton ( zlaper@gmail.com ) and me, Christina Neofotistou.\r<br/>\r<br/>So. This is not very fun, because it's missing the A.I. Nathan was too tired to try.\r<br/>I was also too tired to finish all the graphics.\r<br/>\r<br/>But all in all, it's quasi-polished and we're happy we did it, and it's more than a proof of concept. You can still play it with a friend, if you don't peek over his cards, but it's not very practical.\r<br/>\r<br/>Ok, this is a game where a Demon Lord and an Angel battle it out with cards. The Demon Lord tries to kill the hero in a tower defense fashion. The Angel tries to keep him alive long enough to reach the end of the level.\r<br/>\r<br/>The Demon Lord's traps evolve when a trap card is reinforced with a secondary (and tertiary) effect. \r<br/>\r<br/>Evolution also comes into play in the way the angel's protections and level upgrades to the hero remain with the hero. It's the standard evolution of RPGs.\r<br/>\r<br/>Finally, the very dungeon evolves during the course of the battle. Each time you play through the dungeon, the hero gets to experience a completely different adventure.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>HOW TO PLAY. \r<br/>\r<br/>We tried to keep it super-simple.\r<br/>The Demon Lord (&quot;Keeper&quot; of the dungeon) plays one of the trap cards (pit, crusher, rotating blades, spike, arrow trap) into one of the evil slots (the square with the double evil snake). The card summons a trap on the dungeon tile above it. The Keeper can play as many cards as his or her Mana will allow (your mana pool is the number on the top left corner of the game, next to the blue mana gem. The mana cost is at the bottom left of each card)\r<br/>\r<br/>Once you have at least one trap in place, you can play an Upgrade(Evolution) card on it. This adds effects like mana steal or ice damage to your trap.\r<br/>\r<br/>You then end your turn.\r<br/>\r<br/>The Angel plays his/her own cards, which counter the Keeper's traps or make the hero more capable, in order to survive (extra strength etc).\r<br/>\r<br/>After the Angel ends turn, the battle phase of the game is like this:\r<br/>\r<br/>The hero explores the dungeon one tile at a time, encountering traps or magic potions. Each time he lands on something evil, he takes damage, each time he lands on something good he is healed or given a positive effect.\r<br/>\r<br/>After all three tiles have been played out, the keeper starts again, and so on, until either the hero reaches the end of the dungeon (counted in steps, on the top right) in which case the Angel wins. Or the hero dies and the Keeper wins.\r<br/>\r<br/>Not implemented:\r<br/>- incidental music. I wrote it, but we didn't have time to implement the changes. So enjoy the static music track, it still took me half a day to finish.\r<br/>\r<br/>- a different take on the gameplay, in which the hero walks only one square at a time, and the players only get to play one card. We wanted to check both versions to see which is more fun, but ran out of time.\r<br/>\r<br/>- all the different card art. Turns out it's a huge job. I'm sorry :(\r<br/>\r<br/>- the AI, obviously\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>So, this is our attempt. Enjoy, do PLEASE leave feedback on the gameplay, and check back for updated versions.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>LD is the best!\r<br/>\r<br/>Love,\r<br/>Christina + Nathan\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used: Adobe Flash, Adobe Photoshop, Fruity Loops",

But then I missed it and had to switch to the 3 day jam.\r<br/>\r<br/>This idea randomly came to me and I decided to just work with it making it up as I went along.\r<br/>\r<br/>The basic Idea is that you have a family of slugs that you try to evolve into better slugs. You have to try to keep them alive then get them to mate with other slugs to get better slugs that can do better skills so you can keep them alive. \r<br/>\r<br/>You can train the slugs to do different jobs but it costs resources to train them. The jobs starve the slugs and sometimes use resources to do the different jobs. \r<br/>\r<br/>You also have to watch out for the salt storms. If one hits one of your slugs then it has a chance to partially starve that slug. \r<br/>\r<br/>If you have soldiers the stronger they are reduces the chance that a slug will be starved, also making a blacksmith work to make better stuff for your soldiers will reduce the chance that a slug is starved by a salt storm. \r<br/>\r<br/>A farmer will take 1 resource and be starved by 2 points to make food depending on its strength. \r<br/>\r<br/>A Miner will be starved by 3 points to make resources depending on its strength. \r<br/>\r<br/>A blacksmith will take up 4 food and 10 resources to decrease the chance that a slug will be starved by a salt storm depending on its strength. \r<br/>\r<br/>The color of the slugs have nothing to do with its skills. Mating 2 slugs will take 5 resources and create a new slug with different skills.",

			"htmlDesc": "Okay, so even though I entered the 72-hour Jam, my whole Saturday was filled and I couldn't do much else than come up with an idea for the game, and my Sunday was also slightly disturbed. The game doesn't include the much needed instructions, as I spent the last few hours fixing what I'd broken. Also, it was never intended to have a bot playing it. It's strictly multiplayer.\r<br/>\r<br/>The music was improvised by Andre Sobral, a friend of mine who's a professional guitarist: http://sobral-avainferi-wako.blogspot.pt/\r<br/>\r<br/>--------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>This is a Chess variant with an emphasis on promoting your pieces. In each turn, you may move/capture (just like in regular Chess) or you may promote one of your pieces. It's a multiplayer game, but unfortunately you have to play in on a single computer.\r<br/>\r<br/>The board is divided in to 3 types of terrain: Sea, Land and Castle. Only Sea units may move on the Sea, only Land units may move on Land and all units can move in the Castles. Units close to the opposite type of terrain have the option of promoting to a different terrain version of the same piece (e.g. a Land pawn can promote to a Sea pawn).\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal of the game is to &quot;checkmate&quot; the enemy castle (the 8 squares colored black, white or shades of grey, half belonging to each side). However, because of the time constraints the game doesn't know when the game has been won, so you have to confirm by yourself.\r<br/>\r<br/>By reaching the final row, instead of promoting to whichever piece you want, you earn the option to promote to a Knight (though not immediately), which is the strongest piece in Promotion Chess. Knights are Flying units, which means they can move wherever they want.\r<br/>\r<br/>This isn't explained in the game because I didn't have time, so here's how each piece moves. Please refer to the second &quot;screenshot&quot; (it's not really from the game) for graphic instructions.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Pawn (starting unit): These are just regular old pawns. They move and capture like in Chess.\r<br/>- Land-side Pawn: These move/capture one square diagonally. They're only available on the land side.\r<br/>- Sea-side Pawn: Moves/captures 1 square forward or 1 square to either side.\r<br/>- Square with a hole in the middle: Moves/captures like the King in Chess; 1 square in any direction\r<br/>- Cross-shaped thing: Can move/capture 3 squares to either side or 1 square forward/backward\r<br/>- Double-crossed-shaped thing: Moves/captures 2 squares diagonally and can reflect off the sides of the board or off terrain it can't walk on.\r<br/>- Knight: Just like in Chess.\r<br/>\r<br/>This really isn't a convenient game. Not only is it single-computer multiplayer, it doesn't include in-game instructions. However, it's a pretty interesting design, so please give it a try if you've got someone to play with. Thanks!",

It's cool, I got this...\r<br/>The aliens in this game are the aliens you failed to contain in OMFG Aliens! (my LD#21 entry) and they've evolved... Maybe?\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, in this Rythm/Shooter game, you go for HIGH SCORES, tap direction and action in sync with the beat for EXTRA AWESOME POINT VALUES! Combo Aliens in a single shot, pump up that SYNC bar and charge up to blast away with bigger shots. And if things get TOO hectic, use a PULSE WAVE to clear the screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls : Just press whatever keys you feel best represent a direction and ACTION setup, I got this...\r<br/>\r<br/>Updates : I TOTALLY fixed that bug where the thing didn't work on Windows, and also a little bug with the particles on fast machines.\r<br/>\r<br/>There was this one bug were the aliens were like &quot;Yo, we're going to spawn SUPER fast, like 2 fast 4 you, bro!&quot; and it's cause I'm all like &quot;TO THE MAX&quot; with my math.max() command, but I was supposed to be all math.min(). Now aliens won't be DOUCHEBAGS when you're being too AWESOME!\r<br/>\r<br/>Apparently there's also a bug where everything goes &quot;Yeah, but NO, bro..&quot; and locks up like a deer in headlights.\r<br/>I think I TOTALLY fixed this. I messed with sound retriggering and got it to be COOL when SHOOT sounds were SPAMMED.\r<br/>If it still decides it's going to be UNCOOL and locks up on you, let me know and I'll tell it who's BOSS!",

There's some glitchy bits with movement but otherwise I'm happy with it (engine-wise, that is).\r<br/>\r<br/>tl;dr I spent too much time fiddling with little polish and I ended up not having time to make more levels\r<br/>\r<br/>Story is that these aliens (blugs, cause they're blue and look like slugs to me) are dying out and need to repopulate, so they flew off to another planet to harvest its resources. As soon as they've got enough nutrients, they asexually reproduce and the first one gets transported back to the spaceship. The planet's interesting new plants can force genetic mutations in the blugs that give them new abilities, so the blugs have decided to take evolution into their own hands and use its' power to get even more nutrients and expand the blug empire.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Movement - Left + Right keys\r<br/>Jumping  - Up key\r<br/>Attack   - Z key (not gameplay-useful, only in test room)\r<br/>Fullscreen - F4\r<br/>Quit - ESC",

This game is four games in one, although they all branch off the same beginning. Depending on how you try and control the game, the game will adapt to, in a way, fit that control scheme, mimicking how evolution is in direct response to the surroundings the subject is dealing with. In other words, the game is a creature, and you are its environment.\r<br/>\r<br/>I suppose the goal is to try and find all the evolutionary paths, some harder to find or beat then others, and win at them. So do that. (Hopefully, you can beat all of them this time. Don't worry, I've tested it more than Empty. Meaning I've tested it.)",

The code was how to do a fade with the GUI, and a basic example on jumping.  This is my first compo entry, so I believe it is okay to use code from forums.  If not let me know :)\r<br/>",

Players are given four variable stats. Each time you get a kill,  your current mutation becomes permanent. Generally your character's stats improve through natural selection.

			"htmlDesc": "Mutate? Exterminate! is an arena based schmup style game, where the enemies evolve/mutate with each other, sharing their genetic traits (including colour). \r<br/>\r<br/>There are three types of enemies, Red, Green and Blue. Enemies with strong colour channels (visible in their appearance) will receive attacking abilities matching that colour. These attacks stack, so yellow enemies (strong in red and green) will have both the red and green attacks. Enemies that are strong in all 3 colour channels are known as &quot;PureBred&quot; (White in appearance) and will have all 3 of the attacks, making them the most dangerous. Essentially, Bright enemies are genetically superior, Dull enemies are genetically inferior.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can receive a power up called &quot;The Devolver&quot; (bad revolver pun intended). This gun comes in the three colours, and will be automatically applied to your attacks for a short amount of time. Attacks with The Devolver will remove genetic traits from enemies, for example, a Red Devolver will remove the red colouration from enemies, and thus weakening them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Goal:\r<br/>The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible, to get the best score!\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>W,A,S,D to move.\r<br/>Left Click to shoot.\r<br/>Right click to use a bomb.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Note for download: The zip file is password protected as it contains an executable for the installer (sorry). The password is: ludumdare24\r<br/>Also, sorry for the file size, the game is only about 4mb, but I had to include the DirectX redistributable with the installer.\r<br/>\r<br/>For those wondering, Immortal Games is the indie studio I am co-founder of. I wrote the engine being used, which is written in C++ with lua scripting support and a DirectX11 renderer. This game was made on my own for a bit of fun. I wanted to go in the compo, not the Jam, but unfortunately the engine is our companies proprietary property.",

			"htmlDesc": "Hello, thank you for coming, and I hope you enjoy my first LD compo game: Static.\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal is simple: Create a work of art using a tv with random static as your canvas and remote control buttons as your tools. \r<br/>\r<br/>Static is all about seeing how ideas, creativity, and chaos come together in a primordial ooze that provides a basis from which art evolves.\r<br/>\r<br/>Static: Create, Evolve, Enjoy!\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls are all in game, but the basics are:\r<br/>\r<br/>Mouse - apply tool (left - positive, right - negative)\r<br/>Shift - switch tool\r<br/>Mousewheel or Up/Down arrows - increase/decrease tool size\r<br/>\r<br/>TO PLAY:\r<br/>Simply download the .jar file and run it in java. That's it!\r<br/>\r<br/>Please let me know what you think/how it could be improved and especially if there are any bugs you find. Also, please feel free to share your art and achievements in the comments section! \r<br/>\r<br/>Resizing: Static can be resized; the tv frame will disappear, but everything still works!\r<br/>\r<br/>NOW ON THE INTERWEB!!! (Use Chrome for best experience; Java will ask you for permission to run, and you have to click okay; I'm sorry, but I don't know anyway around that inconvenience. Java Plug-in JRE 7 is tested and works. IcedTea will not work (sorry fellow penguinz)).\r<br/>\r<br/>Achievements:\r<br/>\r<br/>1) Artiste - Make an image using at least 3 different color sets.\r<br/>2) Classiciste - Make a black-and-white image.\r<br/>3) Moderniste - Make an image using the &quot;All Colors&quot; color set.\r<br/>4) Hidden Message - Broadcast a hidden message to a friend using static.\r<br/>5) Time Master - Make an animation using the fast-forward,rewind and pause tools.\r<br/>\r<br/>License:\r<br/>All assets and screenshots are under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, and all code is public domain. Whatever you make with the game, you are free to use in any way you wish, as long you credit me and this game (a la CC BY 3.0).\r<br/>\r<br/>Credits:\r<br/>Thanks to Github, Eclipse, LibGDX, MuseScore, Audacity, GIMP, my family, Mitch and Mary, and everyone who helped to make this possible, including the entire LD Community, and especially fpMiguel who helped a wayward soul on irc. \r<br/>Special thanks to Thotep for his tutorial on LibGDX and applets, which made the new web version possible (http://www.thesecretpie.com/2011/05/being-like-minecraft-or-how-to-run-your.html)",

(and, thanks for reporting it, @infinitedog and @AMSmirnov)\r<br/>\r<br/>Some tips, having watched a couple people play it now:\r<br/>- Try to keep your blobs mostly one color.  If you're getting 'dead pixels' and don't know why, it's because you're mixing too many different colors.\r<br/>- You need to collect a certain count of each color to advance to the next round, watch the numbers at the top to see what to go for next.\r<br/>- If you've got something selected and you just want to look around, click off the current selection first (otherwise you'll end up throwing it).\r<br/>\r<br/>In general, I think the goals need to be simpler and read better, and input needs to be more predictable.  I also have some ideas for how to possibly turn this into more of a puzzle, and remove some of the frustrating bits.\r<br/>\r<br/>I will be iterating on this idea to try to turn it into more of a complete, polished game, and hopefully taking it to the app stores.  If you're interested in seeing what becomes of it, you can follow my company at:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://controlledpanic.com/\r<br/>http://facebook.com/controlledpanic\r<br/>http://twitter.com/CtrlPanic\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks everyone!\r<br/>\r<br/>-----\r<br/>\r<br/>Hi all,\r<br/>\r<br/>First Ludum Dare, and I'm using an engine that was built from scratch (no middleware) over the last month.  I'm pretty happy with what how much I was able to accomplish from where I started.\r<br/>\r<br/>The connection to the theme is tenuous, near the end the gameplay evolved from what I was originally planning to something a bit more 'gamey' for the sake of trying to be fun.  And there's a lot of polish and tuning I didn't have time to get to, but I'm happy that it's fairly complete.\r<br/>\r<br/>I think this plays best on tablets (most of the development was done on a kindle fire), but it should run on any android phone as well, or pc.\r<br/>",

You can transform your characters into one of two new forms by capturing a node. Many of the theme-related elements that were included in the original concept (e.g. different life forms evolving mid-battle and the environment itself changing) are missing due to a lack of time and the game suffers I think from not having been play tested enough as I spent most of my time just trying to get features up and running. The lack of audio is a disappointment but the deadline caught up with me. Instructions are include within the game and repeated below it on the HTML page if you need to refer to them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks for playing and congrats. to everyone who has finished and submitted an entry.\r<br/>\r<br/>[EDIT] Armoured Life-forms cannot capture nodes (this is noted in the instructions but I'm repeating it here because a few people have had issues) and once you have transformed a life-form into an armoured unit then you can't turn it back. This is a known issue that I was unable to correct in the time limit, to play successfully you'll need to keep at least one life form in a normal or speed form. If I find the time to do a post-compo version then I'll add a 'revert' button to turn a unit back to a normal state or put a cap on the number of armour units. Sorry for any inconvenience caused, I just ran out of time :-/",

I wouldn't call it &quot;normal&quot;, but if you just wait, game should start and run fine.\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit bisbis : I made a post compo made of tweaks to make it more playable, get it here : http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/08/29/post-compos-tweaks/ (these tweaks has been made OUTSIDE of the 48h, the real compo is on this page.)",

			"htmlDesc": "Welcome to my first Ludum Dare entry game page!!!! It's a wacky, wavy, inflatable, arm-flailing tube game page warehouse and imporium!!! So I wanted to make a game about the evolution (thus natural selection) of the single celled organism world. But alas, I spent WAY to much time watching Dr. Who. So my game is only half done, a little bit broken, and I had to implement the scoring system at the very end.\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal(now) is to keep away from the big cells, but murder the small cells. You can of course attack whomever you want tho. If your health reaches zero, you die, obviously. :O\r<br/>\r<br/>The cells do have the ability to mutate(which you do not), and they do follow loose guidelines of natural selection. Now because of how the AI is coded, they tend to look like they are just randomly moving about (which I guess sometimes they are) but for the most part they are hunting, or fleeing. Because they mutate, they can and WILL get stronger faster and bigger. But it's quite interesting to sometimes see the small quick ones escape detection and rapidly grow their numbers. But beware, sometimes small ones can be VERY strong.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note!!: I have a 2.something ghz cpu, and once cellular count reached, around 500, I was getting under 30fps. Sorry :(\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy!! \r<br/>\r<br/>P.S. There is no end :( Post your score!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>OH! Controls!\r<br/>movement - WSAD",

			"htmlDesc": "*You need OpenGL &gt;= 2.0*\r<br/>\r<br/>About the Game:\r<br/>\r<br/>How to explain this game? Well, you've got a block, and you can capture some other blocks to grow. But take care of the color of the blocks because each one gives you special ability (see Intro section of the menu). And you can get killed by bigger/stronger combinations.\r<br/>If you manage to grow enough, a boss will spawn.\r<br/>He is easy to kill because i didn't have time to implement everything (see section bellow).\r<br/>\r<br/>What's next?\r<br/>- Web version: there's one but I've got performance issues at this time.\r<br/>- Android version: it's working but there's huge performance issues. I'm working on it.\r<br/>- Multiplayer: I just need a little bit of motivation (tell me if you'd like it!)\r<br/>\r<br/>&lt;SPOILER&gt;\r<br/>I like to make people understand things by playing but if you can't find out the logic of this game, read the next lines.\r<br/>Ok so you die and you don't understand why. There are 3 main kind of blocks (red, yellow, green).\r<br/>- Red gives 3 of power, but no speed\r<br/>- Yellow gives 1 of power, but 10 speed\r<br/>- Green is your protection against insta kills, but if the enemy is far (x3) too stronger than you, it won't protect you.\r<br/>Your blue block is 2 of attack, so you can kill yellow and green, but get killed by red. If you have 1 yellow, red won't kill you. If you have 2 yellow, you can kill a red.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you can't find the boss, just go up when the message appears.\r<br/>Have fun.\r<br/>&lt;/SPOILER&gt;\r<br/>\r<br/>A web version will be available soon. Maybe android too.\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you will have fun!\r<br/>If you liked it, please leave me a comment. And if you found my game sucks please don't tell because it would break my heart! I put too much of myself in the making of this game :D (just kidding, don't hesitate to point out some problems)\r<br/>\r<br/>About the making of this game:\r<br/>\r<br/>Hi everyone!\r<br/>This is my second LD and this time I am a very happy with my work because it is far better than my last game! Plus, I learned to use some cool tools like libgdx and bfxr.\r<br/>I also learned some tips about java during this LD, so my programming skills have been improved too.\r<br/>\r<br/>The bad thing is that i spent 48 hours working on a primary idea and i had to throw everything away because my first project was far too complex to be made by me in 48/72h (My first project was to make a game where each level reprensented a different kind of game... Too many bugs...). You can take a look at the source code of my first project there: https://github.com/eoj/Evolution\r<br/>So i made this game alone and in 24 hours (minus 3 hours of sleeptime!). I really killed myself making it because I didn't want to drop the LD, or send a game I wouldn't be proud of.\r<br/>\r<br/>I feel so happy and tired now :)\r<br/>\r<br/>About Evolution:\r<br/>\r<br/>I voted for Evolution because I though this theme was good to make some new gameplays but finally it was hard to find an idea both feasible and interesting.\r<br/>Maybe 1000 kittens would have been better. I had some good ideas about parallel world.\r<br/>\r<br/>Credits for the font: Yuji Hochimoto\r<br/>Credits for the music: Ozzed http://ozzed.net/\r<br/>\r<br/>Twitter: @DaMightyCthulhu",

((Unless you're on dvorak.)) (((Spoiler for dvorak people: theyarezandxandc)))\r<br/>\r<br/>*See if you can find the secret easter egg also! It's pretty damn cool and explosive!*\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, kudos if you figure out the movie that is referenced throughout the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: Discovered there is a way to fall out of the world. It's not intended, but I'll leave it in for funsies. It's not gamebreaking anyway, since it doesn't happen unless you're asking for it.\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT2: Added a link to a Let's Player / Walkthrough on youtube. I encourage y'all to try to beat it entirely without it though.\r<br/>\r<br/>Like this game? Consider following me on twitter: @SteelRaven7 &lt;3",

Thus, the enemies will evolve over time to fight you better.

Some of them might not be good, so you may not want to take all of them!\r<br/>\r<br/>* Hold the Attack key to charge a pounce, then hit Dash to strike for double damage!

The only thing you don't get to see is the death screen!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: Many congratulations to Ditto, the first winner of Revolvolution! A few others have won too; can you manage it?\r<br/>\r<br/>Notes:\r<br/>Suitable for Leftys: Both Left-Mouse-Button and Right-Mouse-Button work for shooting.\r<br/>Works with both QWERTY and AZERTY keyboards: Use either ZQSD or WASD to move the player. Is your keyboard not supported? Message me so I can keep that in mind for next time, and just use the arrow-keys.\r<br/>\r<br/>Here it is, 48 hours later. My entry to Ludum Dare 24, my first Ludum. Revolvolution is a top-down shooter where as the player progresses they receive worse and worse weapons, until they're left with a spoon.\r<br/>\r<br/>'Evolution' was tough as a theme. But right from the very start, I decided not to go for the obvious cell manipulation. I instead took a twist on the theme and went for 'Devolution', something getting worse over time instead of better (which 'Evolution' can also apply to, if your of the pedantic persuasion). \r<br/>\r<br/>You play as Scotty, an old biker still in his helmet. He is being attacked by a rival biker gang (also in their helmets, which match Scotty's. I'm lazy, okay?). However, as he defends himself, the items he's using against his foes overheat, jam, break, or slip out of his sweaty paw. So, he grabs the next most useful thing to fight on. \r<br/>\r<br/>There are 3 levels, each with about 12 enemies each. However, once you defeat the enemies in a level, you repeat the level with an inferior weapon. The weapons are, in order  of aqcuisition (with poor humour included): Minigun, Flamethrower, Shotgun, Ass-ault Rifle, Badass Dual Pistols, Revolvolution (Revolver), Smackerel (Mackerel to smack with) and Spoony the Spoon (a spoon).\r<br/>\r<br/>Because your weapons get weaker, the game gets harder. It also provides the unique opportunity to take down an enemy with a minigun using only a spoon.\r<br/>\r<br/>The levels themselves also get progressively harder, with more, and stronger, enemies spawned.\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls (also listed on the menu screen) are arrow keys to move (or WASD for QWERTY folk and ZQSD for AZERTY peoples), mouse to aim, and then left mouse button or right mouse button to shoot. But not the scroll-wheel. My mother thought it was the scroll wheel for some reason...\r<br/>\r<br/>So, enjoy Revolvolution! If you manage to win, make sure to post a screenie of the victory screen!\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, about the source: The files are in the .pde format, as the game is made in Processing (www.processing.org). You will need to download Processing to make use of them (it's just a Java lib-type-thing). Or, you might be able to open them in a text editor...\r<br/>\r<br/>But anyway, enjoy!",

It has music, some more sounds, another (2) possible kitten forms, a glowing eye, multi-kitten select, some small bugfixes.\r<br/>\r<br/>Still to do:\r<br/>\r<br/>- More kitten forms, including Ultimate Form\r<br/>- Ending\r<br/>- Better kitten sounds maybe\r<br/>\r<br/>I have some great forms planned that should help make the shape of the final game more plain.",

I still have a lot to learn though.. and the game is not an executable or anything it is just the Eclipse code files. There are things in the code that i could not figure out. But I thought that since I put in the work, I might as well share what I have accomplished :) I hope that I can participate in the next Ludum Dare and actually get a complete game out for you all to enjoy. I will continue to try and learn! Thanks for stopping by!\r<br/>\r<br/>**Edit** Thanks to Cthulhu I fixed the enemies not following the path after level 3 and Towers can not be placed on the path now. Also there is a Game.jar file in the file that will run the game. Thanks Cthulhu!!\r<br/>\r<br/>~Rubicon",

			"htmlDesc": "Evolution Assault is a tactics-style game where your units evolve on the field of battle.  Every time your units reach 10 XP, they can choose to level up and get stronger, or evolve into a new unit.  \r<br/>\r<br/>There is no AI, unfortunately.  The enemy units just sort of stand lifeless as you assault them.  I never wrote an AI before so I focused on what I knew during the 48 hour compo, and ran out of time before I could even attempt any AI instructions.  But you can still attack them (or yourself - a true tactics game never disallows you from killing yourself!) to gain XP.\r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately, I didn't complete data for many of the planned units within the 48 hours, but the game IS &quot;moddable&quot; - you can edit data/Units.xml to add units that will automatically be linked and loaded with the appropriate resources.  Not too hard to figure out if you're actually that motivated.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is in a very basic state.  This is my first LD and I DEFINITELY overplanned for how long the code took to get going.  Not to mention I had never worked in this library before!  Lots of fun though, and definitely a good learning experience for next time.",

			"htmlDesc": "DISCLAIMER: This game is hard, and has a steep learning curve. One might venture to say that I enjoy torturing those who only want to be helpful and rate my game ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>A game where you control a young protagonist named Violet in her search for a cat that she finds too fluffy to resist.\r<br/>\r<br/>On this journey, she will encounter a large population of signs and other curious yet naturally occurring lethal deathtraps, and eventually (read, at the end of the game) learn a useful lesson about evolution: That it's terrible.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls are all explained in game, but only if you don't figure it out yourself. I aimed to have a tutorial system that doesn't treat the player like a three year old.\r<br/>\r<br/>Features:\r<br/>- 40 levels of increasingly difficult platforming spread across 4 different areas. The platforming is based off jumps, double jumps, wall jumps, and even placing your own blocks. There is also a workaround allowing you to skip levels if you have failed them a lot.\r<br/>- An intuitive tutorial built into the early levels, allowing to to figure the game out on your own if you can, and helping you if you can't\r<br/>- A soundtrack straight out of Hollywood, heavily orchestral, albeit a little short, and sound effects which fit in with the music.\r<br/>- Cloth physics based graphics allowing for your character to have a dynamic hairstyle and dress.\r<br/>- A level select which remembers what levels you have beaten , even if you quit the game.\r<br/>- A perverted signpost and several Marilyn Monroe moments\r<br/>- A terrible &quot;I really hate this theme&quot; last minute storyline.\r<br/>- A cat. 'Nuff said.\r<br/>\r<br/>A walkthrough will be coming up in the near future.\r<br/>A level editor will also be released shortly afterwards.\r<br/>\r<br/>KNOWN BUGS:\r<br/>-Sometimes you will lose a placeable block for no apparent reason\r<br/>-You can trap yourself in a freshly placed block \r<br/>\r<br/>The game was made in Gamemaker 8.0 pro in case any of you want to check the source.",

Sorry about that :(\r<br/>\r<br/>Please read the HOW TO PLAY.txt for instructions, but here is a small rundown:\r<br/>\r<br/>(ARROW KEYS) Select solar system. You should start selecting the one with a planet with a small aura around it\r<br/>Tap (W) or (SPACE) quickly to evolve the planet. Once fully evolved, a rocket will automatically start traveling to the closest Planet.\r<br/>Use (D) and (A) to spin planets clockwise / counter-clockwise.  \r<br/>Try getting a rocket to travel to the wormhole before the time runs out\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy! :)\r<br/>\r<br/>*UPDATE 2* I realized that it might be difficult to understand the concept in the beginning, so I added a short How To Play - Video to the links. \r<br/>\r<br/>*UPDATE* I re-packaged the installer of the game, so it should now run in English instead of German. The link is updated, but except the installer, the game is completely unchanged! Unfortunately due to the confusing nature of XNA I wasn't able to deploy a simple .exe file. Sorry :(",

If you're on Linux or Mac OS X, you must install love2d first.\r<br/>\r<br/>Background Story\r<br/>----------------\r<br/>For years, we have treated cows as our belongings. We locked them up \r<br/>in cages, held them in captivity, and milked them dry. All that time, \r<br/>we were unaware that they were waiting for their savior.\r<br/>\r<br/>In an ancient prophecy by Cowstradamus, it was foretold that one cow \r<br/>would rise up to make a difference and liberate the bovine species from \r<br/>the evil clutches of mankind.\r<br/>\r<br/>And now, one cow has appeared that is slightly different from the \r<br/>others; he is the One Cow. One Cow to rule them all. And in his heart, \r<br/>he thinks: &quot;What is a man? A miserable ape!&quot;\r<br/>\r<br/>About the game\r<br/>--------------\r<br/>A humoristic semi-stealth game, in the vein of the first Metal Gear \r<br/>or the classic Castle Wolfenstein.\r<br/>\r<br/>At the start screen, press any key to begin the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal of the game is to kill all the humans. If they see you, they will\r<br/>come toward you. Press space to shoot milk.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Credits\r<br/>-------\r<br/>* Love2d engine: &lt;https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page&gt;\r<br/>* Simerion tiles and images: &lt;http://opengameart.org/comment/12529&gt;\r<br/>* Simple small pixel hearts: &lt;http://opengameart.org/content/simple-small-pixel-hearts&gt;\r<br/>* Cow Attack Basic Action Set: &lt;http://opengameart.org/content/cow-attack-basic-action-set&gt;\r<br/>* Averia (font): &lt;http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/averia&gt;\r<br/>* Tiled Map Editor: &lt;http://www.mapeditor.org/&gt;\r<br/>* Music: Kevin MacLeod &lt;http://www.incompetech.com/m/c/royalty-free/&gt;\r<br/>* Sound Effects: &lt;http://superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/&gt;\r<br/>\r<br/>Code License\r<br/>------------\r<br/>Copyright (c) 2012 Nick Arnoeyts, Adem Aytac\r<br/>\r<br/>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated \r<br/>documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation \r<br/>the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and \r<br/>to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r<br/>\r<br/>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the \r<br/>Software.\r<br/>\r<br/>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE \r<br/>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Basically, faithfully reproducing the mechanisms of evolution in a game. On top of this, I planned to either cast the player as a curator/hunter, who would hunt the animals for food and also try to cull them or lead them in order to produce a healthy balance of animal populations.\r<br/>\r<br/>Obviously, I didn't completely achieve those goals.\r<br/>\r<br/>I did, however, make a pretty good start, particularly considering the complexity of the idea (NEVER AGAIN) and the constraints of Ludum Dare.\r<br/>\r<br/>So here's what IS in the game:\r<br/>\r<br/>Random terrain generation: Creates height-map, populates it with water and grass\r<br/>\r<br/>Random species generation: Creates stats within boundaries defined in code\r<br/>\r<br/>Eating/drinking: I didn't have time to program meat consumption, so they all consume grass. If they don't encounter water soon enough they will start to die.\r<br/>\r<br/>Species breeding: When two animals of the same species meet, there is a chance they will breed. This produces a third animal with a slight mutation\r<br/>\r<br/>Species AI: Very simple, animals perceive each other and react. They will run towards allies and away from enemies based on their stat parameters. Species don't differentiate terrain at all, so be prepared to watch them drown themselves a lot and wander far away from food for no good reason.",

			"htmlDesc": "The game is a top-down shooter with two classes of enemies, each of which has several parameters defining its combat abilities. Each round, the enemies that appear are mutations of those enemies that dealt the most damage to you on the previous round.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can steer the direction of the enemies' evolution by taking more damage from the ones you like. It might not be easy to see that it's working, because of the game's difficulty. Therefore you can start a game in easy mode by pressing Ctrl-Alt-R when the game is paused. In this mode you can for example try to cause the enemies to become a particular colour.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game has been found to run OK on a netbook with Ion graphics. It requires the .Net and XNA redistributables (the &quot;installer&quot; version of the game should be able to download them).\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks go to Brian Corr for moral and technical camaraderie.

			"htmlDesc": "Fight the opponent to win.  Each opponent starts in a corner with the three monsters that are on their side. Its more fun if you find someone to play with you.\r<br/>\r<br/>Use the turns to either move yourself into a protective defensive position.  Or use your monsters turn to breed them a nearby monster that you click on or train one of your monsters by making him fight with either another one of you monsters or your opponents monster.\r<br/>\r<br/>The winner is whoever gets their monsters to the opponent and fights with him.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Here's how the game works:\r<br/>\r<br/>Each team starts with 1 player and 3 monsters.  The color, size and particle effect height represent the strength of the monster.  Whenever the player gets attacked, that side has lost.\r<br/>\r<br/>When you control a unit, they have a green tile under them, and all the people on their team have black tiles under them.  That's how you tell who's turn it is.\r<br/>\r<br/>Most actions involve two clicks, the click to select the action, and the click to select the target.  All actions can only be used in the 8 tiles around the active unit.\r<br/>\r<br/>When you breed two monsters: both are destroyed.  Then 4 new monsters are placed above, below, to the left and to the right of the target monster.  These monsters have stats that can be up to as much as the added stats of their parents.  You must control both monsters.\r<br/>\r<br/>When two monsters fight:  Each picks one of: red, green or blue.  They tend to pick the color they look most like.  A monster who is equally green and red will choose both with equal frequency.  Once they pick a color, one of the monsters may get a 2x bonus depending on the color they picked.  The bigger monster wins.\r<br/>\r<br/>Red beats Green, Green Beats Blue, Blue beats Red.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you're really interested in how combat plays out, here's an example:\r<br/>\r<br/>Monster 'A' has:\r<br/>{red: 70, blue: 30, green: 0}\r<br/>fights Monster 'B' with:\r<br/>{red: 33, blue: 35, green: 32}\r<br/>\r<br/>AB A B %\r<br/>RR _ X 23.1\r<br/>RB X X 24.5\r<br/>RG _ X 22.4\r<br/>BR _ X 9.9\r<br/>BB X _ 10.5\r<br/>BG X _ 0.6",

This seemingly \r<br/>unwieldy nano-bot can do your every bidding after a few rounds of calibration, through some process the box \r<br/>(yes, a very tiny box indeed) calls &quot;Random Mutation!&quot; After a few rounds though, you begin to question whether or \r<br/>not the controls are really evolving to you liking... \r<br/>\r<br/>//// \r<br/>\r<br/>TIRED OF RANDOM CONTROLS? \r<br/>\r<br/>Well, you are in luck, the E-Motion Inc. tech support crew just offered a firmware update, just for you complainers! \r<br/>It gets rid of all that mutation jumbo and allows a simple WASD and SPACE BAR interface. \r<br/>\r<br/>Just drag &quot;GameplayState.class&quot; into your bin folder. Backup the old &quot;GameplayState.class&quot; if you ever want to go back.\r<br/>\r<br/>//// \r<br/>\r<br/>RUNNING THE GAME\r<br/>\r<br/>* I do believe if your screen cannot support the resolution of the game (1250x800), you will still see some of the game cut off, \r<br/>but it may actually run alright now due to a fix, try moving the LDGame.class into the bin folder. That may allow you to\r<br/>play the game (1250x750), but if your character still flys off the screen, please don't downrate.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>To Run The Game:\r<br/>\r<br/>Extract and make sure folder containing bin and data and the other folders is named exactly &quot;LD24&quot; \r<br/>\r<br/>Windows: Double click run.bat\r<br/>\r<br/>For other OS or if its still not working in Windows:\r<br/>\r<br/>Run the following console command when you are inside your games directory:\r<br/>\r<br/>javaw.exe -Djava.library.path=%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib -classpath %CD%\\bin;%CD%\\lib\\slick.jar;%CD%\\lib\\lwjgl.jar LDGame\r<br/> \r<br/>If its still not working it may be because you are using an old version of javaw.exe for some reason, despite the fact you\r<br/>may have the latest jave installed. Try running a command like one of these instead (would be different for other OS, just find javaw.exe for your OS in a jre7, or java 1.7 kind of folder):\r<br/>\r<br/>For x86 java install on 64 bit machine (Most likely): &quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7\\bin\\javaw.exe&quot; -Djava.library.path=%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib -classpath %CD%\\bin;%CD%\\lib\\slick.jar;%CD%\\lib\\lwjgl.jar LDGame\r<br/>\r<br/>For x64 java install or x86 intstall on 32 bit machine (Most likely): &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7\\bin\\javaw.exe&quot; -Djava.library.path=%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib;%CD%\\lib -classpath %CD%\\bin;%CD%\\lib\\slick.jar;%CD%\\lib\\lwjgl.jar LDGame\r<br/>\r<br/>//// \r<br/>\r<br/>Notes: \r<br/>\r<br/>You may notice that some features did not get implemented. Originally, you would get a best score with an \r<br/>iteration, and then try and beat that score with the next iteration. \r<br/>\r<br/>Then the iteration you did the best with would play a bonus round, and get saved in the High Score list. These \r<br/>control configurations that made it to the High Score would be reloadable at the player's will. \r<br/>\r<br/>To do a little bit of that now, you have to relaunch the game itself. Annoying, but I sadly ran out of time to \r<br/>implement those features, although I was quite close. \r<br/>\r<br/>I also have only tested on Windows. Mac and Windows peeps, let me know how its going!",

Windows stopped working, I didn't have time to reinstall it, so I moved to linux, However never doing images in linux, and trying to create images using a Inkscape I had never used before was a disaster! After staying up all night trying to create images that look terrible. I had wasted a good portion of a day and didn't have much to show for it. So I got to coding not knowing what I would do about images, then I ran into another problem, linux wasn't picking up keyStrocks in Applet(I was trying to use applet instead of my usual graphics because everyone like game you don't have to download) Finally I got keystroks to work in eclipse but when I uploaded my first game to the website keystrock stopped working on linux, at that point I just went to bed. Overall it was a disaster... But I still wanted to enter something so I can vote. Sorry for how bad the game is. ",

Sorry for the bad ending, I have to go to college and there's no time!\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: I've changed my game to a Jam entry (I hope that's not against the rules), so I could add a shield in the game. It was already programmed, I just decided to take it away at the last minute because you could basically beat the whole game in seconds without ever getting hit, using it. But then, I was tired as hell and couldn't think of a better way. Only now I noticed that I could make the char unmovable, while he is using the shield hahaha.\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>Finally it's done! \r<br/>\r<br/>It was supposed to be much bigger, but we all know how things work out in jams like these, right? Hahaha.\r<br/>\r<br/>I apologise for the blurry houses in the screenshot, I don't have a videocard (mine broke a couple days ago) and the on-board one I'm using doesn't have Webgl, so some things won't display correctly. Also the FPS is crazy in here. But at least it's done! There was a shield but I had to remove it at the last minute, because it made the game too easy (you could just press and hold and go through all of the game).",

Machines have evolved, and\r<br/>they're gunning for us. Ray Kurzweil predicted it, but he didn't imagine that\r<br/>it would start an armageddon between man and machine. Our three heroes, \r<br/>Kurtz, Tuxxer and Charlie, set off in a daring do or die adventure to destroy\r<br/>the central computer which runs all of the AI.\r<br/>\r<br/>Destroy the evil AI ships so you can plant the nuke at the central computer.\r<br/>You have three unique lives to do so.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game has three subtle modes:\r<br/>\r<br/>Easy: Finish the game. Everyone is expendable.\r<br/>Medium: Finish the game only losing one comrade.\r<br/>Hard: Finish the game with the whole team in one piece.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hints:\r<br/>======\r<br/>\r<br/>* Use your movement keys to avoid the falling bullets.\r<br/>* Space to shoot!\r<br/>* +1pt for every hit!\r<br/>* -1pt for every miss.\r<br/>\r<br/>Featuring:\r<br/>==========\r<br/>\r<br/>* Three original almost-human characters made in GIMP!\r<br/>* 13 original things that look like spaceships made in Alchemy!\r<br/>* Original music made in LSDJ!\r<br/>* Over 35 unique sound bytes made by one voice actor! (There's 36)\r<br/>* Tons of fun dialog that will make you think twice about your life!\r<br/>* Awesome slash screens that will make you pee your pants!\r<br/>* Beautiful dynamic menus with three different backgrounds!\r<br/>* Font made with tons of pixels in fontstruct.\r<br/>* Awesome sound effects effortlessly generated with bfxr using all eight bits!\r<br/>* Wild and Crazy 3D like moving background thing that will eat your CPU!\r<br/>\r<br/>Warnings:\r<br/>=========\r<br/>\r<br/>**If you are running OS/X, you may find that it will lag.**\r<br/>To fix this, disable SFX in the main menu!",

All the info to play the game is into the game itself (Enter to start, arrows to move, Z attacks, space jumps. More controls check out the info screen in the game)\r<br/>\r<br/>You can press enter in the intro to skip it.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is quite challenging, but the Easy mode gives you 99 continues. If you just want to check out the whole game, play on easy mode. (The difference between difficulty levels is just how many lives and continues you start with)\r<br/>\r<br/>It was made inside the 48 hours of the Compo deadline, but we used the extra time for the Jam to test if everything was ok. All content, coding and resources for the game were made in the LD24 weekend.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Gbell Games is a team made of high-school students (and one teacher) from Colegio Graham Bell in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. It begun as a &quot;after class&quot; project with students learning the basics of game development. This is not only their first attempt at Ludum Dare, but it's also the first attempt of making a game for most of them.\r<br/>\r<br/>More stuff will come out from this team in the future!\r<br/>\r<br/>Programming:\r<br/>Rafael Lima\r<br/>Caio Barberan\r<br/>\r<br/>Additional Programming:\r<br/>Maurucio Falbo\r<br/>Nathalia Borges\r<br/>\r<br/>Graphics:\r<br/>Nathalia Borges\r<br/>Luiza Fernandes\r<br/>Luana Fernandes\r<br/>\r<br/>Additional Graphics:\r<br/>Lucas Cid\r<br/>Caio Barberan\r<br/>\r<br/>Music and Sound Effects:\r<br/>Gabriel Gomes\r<br/>\r<br/>Plot and Logistic:\r<br/>Lucas Cid\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks to: Rosangela Gomes, Denise Vilardo, Claudio Lopes, Valeria Graca, Deise Nicacio, Paloma Cosentino, Alan Barreira, Katharine Akyer, Sandra de Lima, Cleber M. de Souza, Hannah Wong, Rachel Cid, Paulo Roberto, Cesar Goncalves, Celso Rocha, Claudia Ximenes, Renato Borges, Wilson Nunes\r<br/>Potter the Dog :D\r<br/>and\r<br/>all staff from Colegio Graham Bell \r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE:\r<br/>\r<br/>The game does have an issue with the Audio... you may hear cracks when the music loops, and when the music is loading an annoying sound may appear for a couple of seconds. This happens in some computers, but it doesn't happen in other computers. This is an issue with how GameMaker handles MP3s. We should had used an external library to handle the music of the game, but as we didn't state it before, it would break the rules, and there were no time to code one from scratch.\r<br/>\r<br/>We really only noticed that when we begun testing the game in other computers and saw it happening.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's a real shame, since the music is actually very good IMO, when it's not cracking :/\r<br/>\r<br/>Porting the code to GameMaker Studio would probably solve the problem, but this would require some changing in the code, which I am not sure would break the rules.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you want to skip levels, there's a cheat to do it: press enter+end at the same time. You can keep skipping levels up until you see the ending, though you will miss all the bosses of the game, which are all very cool I think :)",

			"htmlDesc": "BLOCKS.\r<br/>\r<br/>Summary:\r<br/>\r<br/>Explore the terrain and collect resources until your life expires; when it does, control shifts to another block-organism.  After you've played through a generation of block-organisms, you get to play through the descendants of the previous generation, created by a pseudo-Genetic-Algorithm/upgrade system.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Your upgrades/mutations will be visible on your blocky children.  Different mutations will benefit you in different ways, such as increasing speed, jump height, foraging range, swim speed, breath underwater, lifespan, and more.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE: \r<br/>\r<br/>The feedback I've been getting is pretty unanimous in that the game is unclear/too hard.  I can't fix that because of the 48 hour restriction obviously, but I will try to explain the things that are in the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS:\r<br/>\r<br/>- WASD to move\r<br/>- Space to jump\r<br/>- R to restart\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is intentionally very hard at the beginning (though I think I overdid it).  You die quickly so that you can get to the next generations more quickly, and experience the evolving portion of the game faster.  Don't sweat it if you die a lot without getting any food; even if you only get food one or two times, you will still see upgrades in the next generation.  On the flip side if you think it's too difficult, it might be that the map generator handed you a really terrible map.  In this case refreshing/restarting may fix everything.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are five types of terrain, and five types of food which correspond with them:\r<br/>\r<br/>Jungle - Has dark green tiles that are impassable, and food runs away from you\r<br/>Desert - Has no obstacles, but has very scarce food\r<br/>Ocean - Swimming slows you down, and you can run out of air\r<br/>Canyon - Has black tiles that you can fall into and die.  This is where jumping can be useful.\r<br/>Marsh - Slows your movement, and has invisible food that only comes into view as you get closer to it.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>In later generations, your evolutionary progress shows in what look like food blocks that are on your block.  The benefits of these upgrades mirror the challenges of the respective terrain.\r<br/>\r<br/>Jungle food - Makes you faster, so you can catch food that runs away\r<br/>Desert food - Increases lifespan substantially, and makes each food regenerate substantially more life\r<br/>Ocean food - Makes you swim faster and gives you more air\r<br/>Canyon food - Increases jump height\r<br/>Marsh food - Marsh terrain slows you down less, and your search range for hidden food increases\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope that helps somewhat.",

At the end of each round of meteors, you are given the choice of 3 possible upgrades which change how the character plays slightly giving you and advantage through speed, size, or health.\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm overall pretty pleased with it, I would have liked to have done something deeper and with a more interesting concept behind it but I was drawing blanks on the theme (and, as previously mentioned, I haven't really done this before).",

A robot that collects and imitates lifeforms, a &quot;soul jar&quot; from space, crash lands and must return to his ship.  Along the way you teach it how to behave and depending how you influence and evolve his AI will result in several different endings.\r<br/>\r<br/>His AI will develop based on your actions, as he learns from you.  If you become aggressive shooting your way through the enemies the robot will take on aggressive traits, eventually even targeting you, if you heal, carry and protect him he will learn to protect you also, if you are greedy and consume all the food and liquids and items he will adopt those traits also.  There are lots of possibilities with how he acts though I kind of ran out of time as the list is still largely unimplemented.  Future version maybe?\r<br/>\r<br/>Short Trailer here:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://youtu.be/Q1eV13gY5tk \r<br/>",

Try to take the best photo ever! Or fill up your collection of new species you have personally discovered, then name them after yourself! Or just enjoy the view and watch the birds muck about.\r<br/>\r<br/>Requires XNA 4.0. Should work on most machines, but if it doesn't, let me know and I'll try to fix it ASAP!\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls are editable in-game.

Simply click on the photo in the album, then save to disk. You can also enable autosaving every new photo taken automatically in the options menu.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please note: Key configs are persistent, but all other options are not.\r<br/>\r<br/>----------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Update 27/08\r<br/>\r<br/>I've added a post-compo version with a widescreen resolution of 1280x720, which makes photographs of 1920x1080. So if you want to make prettier photographs, now you can. The system requirements went up though as you need a slightly more modern video card now. And the camera lens rectangle is slightly smaller than the photos. But other than that, everything should still work fine. \r<br/>\r<br/>Also, don't rate this version! Rate the original.",

The main thing that's missing is a win condition. At first, you were just going to get three chances to beat any one level. If you died three times in a row: game over. Your score would have been either the number of levels completed or the number of generations survived. We scrapped that though after realizing that some levels took a lot more than three tries to &quot;figure out&quot; and that it was quite satisfying to finally beat them. Now we're thinking about having a set number of levels and your score would simply be your completion time.\r<br/>\r<br/>The level generation uses a genetic algorithm. You play a set of procedurally generated levels, and the game evaluates them for fitness; then, it takes the most fit levels and mates them together, creating a new generation of offspring levels. Since there is no mutation and the levels only have a single &quot;chromosome&quot;, they tend to evolve into a very uniform population after a few generations, which eventually leads to getting very similar levels until you restart, and since there is no win or end condition to force a restart, you can essentially get stuck playing levels that are nearly identical to one another repeatedly.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are also a lot of sound effects we didn't get around to putting in but those will be added in future versions.",

Get it here:\r<br/>http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/libalure1\r<br/>\r<br/>Or, if all that fails:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://opensludge.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/opensludge/doc/SLUDGELinuxHelp/Compiling_SLUDGE_on_Ubuntu.html\r<br/>\r<br/>or download the Windows ZIP and run:\r<br/>wine SLUDGEEngine.exe game.slg\r<br/>\r<br/>(Note to self - learn to make self-contained packages)\r<br/>\r<br/>- - - - - - - - - \r<br/>\r<br/>Well crikey, this was a rather interesting experiment. We did not finish, but submitted something that at least vaguely resembles what we wanted to end up with and can actually be played through.\r<br/>\r<br/>We saw &quot;Evolution&quot; and went &quot;Pokemon, yay&quot;... the resulting game not quite that, although the combat system was going to be reminiscent.\r<br/>\r<br/>Things that did not make it:\r<br/>- Combat system\r<br/>- Monster fights featuring said combat system\r<br/>- Loads of sounds\r<br/>- Some music\r<br/>- Some NPCs\r<br/>- NPC animations\r<br/>- Monster animations\r<br/>- A few plot points\r<br/>- Some additional locations\r<br/>\r<br/>How this was made:\r<br/>- Loads of people helped to build the sets we used, in Minecraft.\r<br/>- Minecraft worlds were converted to Wavefront objects using mcobj\r<br/>- Scenes rendered in Blender\r<br/>- Intro/Outro made in Maya\r<br/>- Game built in OpenSLUDGE\r<br/>\r<br/>All names are in the credits. \r<br/>\r<br/>Writing of dialogue by WelshPixie. Music by Shadowthewedgehog95, Shakdude, Creammin (not used yet). Fonserbc made a texture pack and mod to help the builders see what the final output might be while they were building. Intro, outro and sound effects (many still to be used) by Kasperophof and kongering.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks to everyone in the http://indiesquish.com/ community who helped out!\r<br/>\r<br/>(Gah, upload to server going slowly)",

Powered by Crafty, it is smooth to play and easy to enjoy ;-) Darwin is watching you.\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions:\r<br/>To win you have to hide your white player. To do so, move it to a place in between four tiles that matches with the pattern your player consists of. If this place is not arranged yet, you can pass items to slide the traces and modify patterns. When an enemy has found its place time runs out faster. Before the round ends, make sure your pattern matches at least with two or three tiles you are placed on. After each round Darwinci eleminates one of the least hidden players. Get through the four rounds to win the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun and post your comments!",

If you like reading science fiction stories or watching science fiction movies or playing survival horror games, you might enjoy it. \r<br/>\r<br/>The game was made with Inform 7. You can play it online with any computer, iOS device such as iPad or IPhone, Android phone or tablet, or pretty much anything with a CPU and a browser that has javascript.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please let me know what you think. I am going to withhold providing the source code or any hints until the last day of voting. I really want to see if anyone can solve this one on their own without cheating.\r<br/>\r<br/>I know it's hard to commit to the time and effort needed to play an IF game when most submitted games can be evaluated in a couple minutes. So play all the other games, with their exciting graphics and gameplay, and then later when things have died down and you feel like something meaty, come by and give this one a try!\r<br/>",

So here's the result.\r<br/>\r<br/>You, the player, are trying to gradually build up society by encouraging different values. If your people disagree with your values, they will start Revolutions, drastically shifting society's values and harming your efforts.\r<br/>\r<br/>(Believe it or not, I'm not actually trying to push any kind of social or political agenda here. I just thought it would make for good gameplay. Did I succeed? You decide.)\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE: I've discovered the Love2D WebGL Player at https://github.com/ghoulsblade/love-webplayer , and I've put a WebGL version of Evolution Or Revolution online.

The six characters each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses:\r<br/>\r<br/>- Some move swiftly.\r<br/>- some attack at range.\r<br/>- Some have armor to absorb damage.\r<br/>- Some have special abilities.\r<br/>\r<br/>This uses the theme Evolution through the fact that you must adapt to your present situation, by shape shifting into the most useful form. \r<br/>\r<br/>However, you only have finite energy, both for shape shifting and for special abilities, so use it wisely. You can collect energy crystals to replenish your reserves.\r<br/>\r<br/>The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>Information\r<br/>^^^^^^^^^^^\r<br/>\r<br/>- The game is controlled with the mouse only. LEFT click to walk. RIGHT click to attack. If you right click a point beyond your attack range, then you make a &quot;push&quot; towards it, a combination of attacking and stepping forward.\r<br/>\r<br/>- The close button on the window will safely terminate the application.\r<br/>\r<br/>- This application uses FMOD Sound System, copyright &Atilde;&Acirc;&copy; Firelight Technologies Pty, Ltd., 1994-2011.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun, and remember to post your high score below :D",

The super moves this would enable don't exist, but it does allow you to change your powerup lineup.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is pretty unfinished, but is playable and many of the ideas we set out to impliment are there. I recommend using the earth element to see some nice boss art. Unfortunately a few bugs cropped up at the last moment that I was unable to kill, that keep some great art from Paul from being seen in the submission version. I feel terrible about this, so I put said art in screenshot 2. It doesn't appear in game in that form, but it should.\r<br/>\r<br/>I know background scrolling is horridly broken, sorry.",

First time working with Pygame, which has been amazing!\r<br/>\r<br/>The game: Your goal is it to recreate the evolution of the planet earth from it's early beginnings as boiling magma sphere to the evolution of life, humans and civilization.\r<br/>You combine multiple Elements to unlock new ones.

The game uses Python 3 + Pygame, so if you have that installed, the source version will work fine. If you have, I'd love to hear from you. I'm still looking for someone to help me build the OS/X version. ",

You can use arrows to turn around the arm (don't keep pressed , press multiple times instead, as if there are paths), so you can avoid collision with blocks and enemies. As time passes, player will encounter with (in order) Fires, Bacterias, Bugs,Axe, Bombs and UFOs. \r<br/>I am not an artist to that is what i could do.

They all do different things when you push any of the buttons from A to Z. (Or combinations of buttons) If you get slimes to the flag, then your new slimes will be descended from them. To finish the later, more difficult levels, you need to play the earlier levels with the goal of training certain keys to do the moves you'll need for the difficult levels. For example, when you find a key that makes slimes jump, train them to jump higher. When you find keys that make them move right or left, train them to move faster. This will require that you leave the slower slimes behind.",

And boy did we do much better this time around  (compared to the last one).\r<br/>\r<br/>The last game we made together was very much sub-par at best.  We felt much better about this game.  We all worked really hard on it, and we hope you can tell.\r<br/>\r<br/>Having said that - we didn't get to finish everything in that we wanted to - AND it's buggy!!!  First, you can't die - you just continue to loose points - second, the enemies only attack you once you attack them.\r<br/>\r<br/>So, without further ado, here is our Ludum Dare game, ThroughOutTheAges.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are four eras in the game.  Each equipped with different enemies and characters.  Collect enough EVO points to advance through the ages.  The goal of the game is to defeat all the enemies and evolve into the other ages.\r<br/>\r<br/>Keys - arrows or wasd to move around - 'E' a shortcut to evolve.\r<br/>\r<br/>Mouse click on the enemies to fight - and to pick up items.\r<br/>\r<br/>'I' is your inventory.  You can equip items and take health potions.\r<br/>\r<br/>Not everything is polished (and there are lots of bugs and missing pieces!!) - but we hope you enjoy it none the less!\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks",

Sorry!\r<br/>Source includes all GMRES, MCSZ etc files used as well as the GMK. If you use the source's debug mode, it'll automatically unlock all levels and will display some lines and circles around weapons that I used to calculate direction.\r<br/>Story could do with a little improvement but for 48 hours it's okay.\r<br/>Saving is minimal, I was kinda in a rush so I used GM's default saving rather than writing my own, which I usually do in bigger projects.\r<br/>Anyway, have fun playing Unlikely Companion, and tell me what you think.",

Then you grow wings and become a flying reptile. After that you learn how to file breathe and become something like a dragon... *idea stops somewhere here* ...finally you evolve into intelligent\r<br/>humanoid dragon race. Your planet is almost destroyed but your race smartest scientists invent time traveling machine to go back in the past at the beginning of your evolution to undo their sin against nature. The scientist cant send a message in time to simple creatures like cells and reptiles\r<br/>so they implant the message into your DNA. *then the game starts from cell again* Somewhere in humanoid stage your race learns to read DNA from species and understand that there is a message to them from the other future. Your race becomes the protectors of nature and balance. And you eliminate everyone who breaks the balance.\r<br/>\r<br/>#About:\r<br/> You start as a cell and then evolve into snake and then into reptile.

They also heal you.\r<br/>    Water flow(the blue lines) - they push you in the direction of the flow. They also push bio material. However,\r<br/>Viruses &quot;swim&quot; to the oposite direction of the flow\r<br/>   *Snake Stage:\r<br/>    Bubbles(the empty circles) - you have to colect them to get DNA. Also your size grows when you eat them.\r<br/>    Bubbles filled with plankton - the only difference from normal bubbles is that they heal you.\r<br/>    Bad Bubbles - they do damage if you eat them\r<br/>    Snake Body - if you eat yourself you get damage :D\r<br/>  *Reptile Stage:\r<br/>    Dear-Man Alien(the yellow creature) - it files very fast\r<br/>and you have to catch it with your tongue.\r<br/>\r<br/>Every stage has different controls which are showed before the stage starts.\r<br/>\r<br/>#Controls:\r<br/> Move - W,A,S,D\r<br/> Tongue - Right Mouse Button\r<br/> Change text between stages - Esc,Space,Enter,Left Click\r<br/>\r<br/>#Cheats/Debug:\r<br/> Go To Game Over - G\r<br/> Go To End - H\r<br/> Next Level - PageUp\r<br/>\r<br/>#Unfinished(due to time):\r<br/> In snake stage the snake is buggy because I had to finish the other stages.\r<br/> Reptile stage was supposed to be stage where you catch flies and your tongue grows so that you can reach higher flies.\r<br/>\r<br/>#Notes:\r<br/> If you get a crash or the game runs too fast or find any thing wrong use the &quot;cheats&quot; to see the other stages \r<br/> If you find a bug that isn't stated in the bugs section post it in the coments\r<br/>\r<br/>#Bugs:\r<br/>   In snake stage you will see the snake flashing\r<br/>   Sometimes in last stage you get random GameOver\r<br/>   Sometimes there is object left from the last stage",

Turns out Unity doesn't really like Spritesheets and has minor errors during coordinate calculation. I have provided a web link for a revised version that corrects this problem. The gameplay is exactly the same, it just has a few graphical enhancements (I changed the ground textures as well as an experiment). If you really can't stand the major graphical glitch of the original version (like I do), do give the updated one a try!",

It'll tell you what you need to do.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>SOUND\r<br/>If you do not want sound, use the command line argument &quot;nosound&quot;. Not sure if this will work with the bundles, but it very well may.\r<br/>\r<br/>Example:\r<br/>\r<br/>love ./path/to/And\\ Thus\\ She\\ Spake.love nosound\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>INPUT\r<br/>This game works best with a mouse. Trackpads tend to be jerky because you have to keep picking up your fingers.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>-- INSTALLATION ------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>All of the bundles have been compressed into an archive container of some sort, so all you need to do with them is unzip to where you want them, and play!\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: For Ubuntu (and other distro) users, I apologize, I do not know enough about packaging apps in linux to really give bundling a shot. Perhaps for next LD, if I don't go back to the web!\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: For the windows x64 bundle, I cannot test it out since I do not have a 64 bit install. If anyone reports a problem, I'll just take the bundle down. If you don't see a bundle, I'd just recommend getting LOVE from their website (love2d.org).\r<br/>\r<br/>Some quick instructions for installing love (refer to love2d.org for full instructions):\r<br/>\r<br/>UBUNTU (PPA)\r<br/>- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bartbes/love-stable\r<br/>- sudo apt-get update\r<br/>- sudo apt-get install love\r<br/>\r<br/>OS X:\r<br/>- get https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.8.0-macosx-ub.zip\r<br/>- unzip and install into your applications directory\r<br/>- right click on And Thus She Spake.love, Open With -&gt; Other...\r<br/>- check Always Open With and browse and select the love.app you just copied to your applications directory\r<br/>\r<br/>WINDOWS (32-BIT):\r<br/>- download and run installer: https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.8.0-win-x86.exe\r<br/>\r<br/>WINDOWS (64-BIT)\r<br/>- download and run installer: https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-0.8.0-win-x64.exe\r<br/>\r<br/>OTHER\r<br/>- You can get the source code, zipped versions for Windows (instead of an installer), and specific Ubuntu versions for various releases and for 32/64-bit versions, just take a look at love2d.org",

But be warned, the other AI colonies wont take too kindly to having their territory invaded!\r<br/>\r<br/>Ants start with a length of 2 blocks, these are the &quot;children&quot; and cannot reproduce, after 120 seconds these become &quot;adults&quot; and gain a 3rd block (this is how they remain for most their life, before becoming old [4 blocks] and then dying of old age).\r<br/>During the life of your ants they can be assigned one of 3 tasks, digging, reproduction or fighting/attacking. The chance of each of these succeeding is based on the ants level in the respective area (and so will not always work first time, be patient). A child ant takes the highest of its parents levels, and breeding specialised ants is to your advantage. The colour of the ants head indicates how specialised it is the 3 stats (R,G,B colour components, one for each stat).\r<br/>Ants move randomly around the grid unless you use the &quot;Set Target&quot; button and click another ant to head towards, the selected ant is highlighted green and the target red, if you cannot see the target use the &quot;Find Target&quot; button to centre it in your view.\r<br/>Some of the blocks that your ants dig are converted into indestructible blocks (shown in the HUD) which can be placed for your own amusement with right click.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is some sound! for death, killing and reproduction. If you play it long enough you may hear them ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>Extract the entire zip before attempting to run!\r<br/>\r<br/>May also run on OS/X and Linux using mono (tested and working on ubuntu 12.04 with mono-devel package and suitable opengl drivers)",

			"htmlDesc": "This is more like a 9 hour game - I did the bulk of the work on an airplane flight across the country. So I apologize for the hasty crap art and the lack of game balance.\r<br/>\r<br/>The JAR is all uploaded now, and the applet is working. If you get poor performance in the applet I suggest downloading the JAR, but gameplay should be analogous on both. The source is included in the JAR if you unzip it.\r<br/>===================================\r<br/>\r<br/>You are a renegade angel who has decided that man should have the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge in order to evolve from Homo Erectus to Homo Sapiens. The path to the fruit is fraught with dangers, however, and the lowly Homo Erectus are not strong enough to make it there alone. You must selectively breed the Homo Erectus until they are strong enough to fight off the feral creatures blocking the way to the apple.\r<br/>\r<br/>TO MOVE, LEFT CLICK ANYWHERE on screen. You will automatically path find. In addition, HOLD SPACE to lure Homo Erectus after you, RIGHT CLICK OR SHIFT-CLICK a Homo Erectus to tell it to go breed, and HOLD SHIFT OR S to bring up a stats display for each Homo Erectus.\r<br/>\r<br/>The forbidden fruit is at the bottom right of the map. The monsters get stronger as you go, and you may also find different types of Homo Erectus along different side paths.\r<br/>\r<br/>TIPS:\r<br/>A good strategy really is to just select for fertility first, and then when you have very high fertility start selecting for attack and defense. The game is not terribly well balanced so you can pretty quickly get a small army that can win you the day. Also, I erred on the side of easy so it's very unlikely for a child to be worse than its parent in any way - if you keep breeding you're golden. I also implemented but later removed an inbreeding function (inbred creatures are much much worse) but I didn't have time to communicate this aspect at all so it's removed.\r<br/>\r<br/>========================\r<br/>WHAT THE STATS MEAN\r<br/>========================\r<br/>power - how much damage you do\r<br/>defense - reduces the damage taken from enemies by this much\r<br/>dodge - the percent chance to completely avoid an attack (max is 75%)\r<br/>hitPoints - how much life you have\r<br/>fertility - how many offspring you can have (maximum). When 2 creatures mate, the amount of offspring is (parentA.fertility + parentB.fertility) / 2.\r<br/>\r<br/>So in combat damage done to a defender is:\r<br/>attacker.power - defender.defense\r<br/>but only if rand() &gt; defender.dodge\r<br/>\r<br/>------------&gt;Known issues:\r<br/>-Splash screen says go the bottom left. GO TO THE BOTTOM RIGHT ACTUALLY. Whoops.\r<br/>-Game hangs momentarily at the start presumably due to some assets needing to load which I didn't bother to do beforehand.",

I wanted it to be about adapting to a hostile, harsh environment, but I didn't know how to make it more interactive. So, eventually I just added enemies and a lot of shooting. It is playable, just not very fun. Also, I wanted to do music and sound FX for it, but I ran out of time. :-/\r<br/>\r<br/>Here is a more in-depth description of the game, from its readme:\r<br/>You control a group of mono-gendered organisms who must escape their hostile environment. You start off with 4 organisms. Each level you take control over them one by one. Your goal is to lead them to safety, symbolized by a waving flag. After each level you get the choice to breed your organisms. Once you've bred two organisms they will be replaced by two new ones, their children, whose genetic code will be a random blend of their parents' genes.\r<br/>Passing on genes works like in real genetics. Every organism has two sets of their genes, one inherited from each parent.Genes have dominant and recessive variants, called alleles. Dominant alleles are written with a capital, recessive alleles with a lower-case letter. Dominant and recessive alleles provide different traits for the organism, for example a gene's dominant allele can cause the organism to grow smaller, while its recessive variant can cause the exact opposite - to grow bigger. If an organism has both the dominant and the recessive allele, the dominant will override the recessive one's effect.\r<br/>The game includes two environments, selected at random: a cold one, covered in snow, and a hot one, covered in sand. Different genes provide protection against the heat and the cold, while other traits can cause the organism to be more vulnerable to the environmental effects. The hazards increase each level.\r<br/>Surviving 5 levels wins the game.  If all 4 organisms die, the game is lost.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls in the game:\r<br/>Cursors/WASD - Move\r<br/>Space/Y/Z - Shoot\r<br/>\r<br/>The game requires the .NET Framework 4 and the XNA Framework Redistributable 4.\r<br/>You can download these from:\r<br/>\r<br/>.NET Framework 4:\r<br/>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851\r<br/>\r<br/>XNA Framework Redistributable 4:\r<br/>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914",

To succeed, he needs to evolve the right abilities: walking, jumping, swimming, flying, breathing, and shooting. The more he eats, the more abilities he can evolve, and the more easily he gets around.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game includes procedurally generated caves, 8 types of organism, and 15 difficulty levels.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you get stuck, press &quot;Q&quot; to commit suicide.  You can also start at any level you like by selecting the level in the title screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>To play the Android version, you probably need a big screen (tablet) to be able to point accurately enough. \r<br/>\r<br/>The Jar runs as 640x480 by default.  You can pass x and y size as command line parameters. Pass 0,0 to get full screen. Example:\r<br/>\r<br/>java -jar NomsEvolvathlon.jar 1024 768\r<br/>\r<br/>Known bugs: the player sometimes floats around uncontrollably in thin air (but eventually lands on his feet again).\r<br/>\r<br/>I have also recorded screengrabs for a timelapse, but I will upload it later.",

			"htmlDesc": "Info\r<br/>&quot;Bomb the Bunnies&quot; is a game about trying to fight back the ever-growing bunny menace. Given that they are asexually-reproducing, that means you have to act quick to place your time bombs to thin their numbers before they grow out of control. Also, with every new generation of bunnies, mutations are possible, so over time the population can get faster, gain better eyesight (for avoiding your bombs), or tougher.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls\r<br/>Bombs place themselves automatically several times a second, so keep your mouse cursor moving to where you want an explosion to occur. The bomb will go off in 2.5 seconds, damaging or killing bunnies in its blast radius.\r<br/>\r<br/>Confession\r<br/>This game represents the result of many concessions that ultimately had to be made as a result of a very, very busy weekend that left with me with only about half a day of actual programming time. As such, I must apologize if the game is poorly balanced or rather shallow. I did the best I could with the time I had, and the result only barely represents the original concept I had in mind when I began. I also participated in the warm-up the week prior, so if you're interested, you can also check out the game I made for that at &lt; http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24-warmup/?action=preview&amp;uid=10343 &gt;.\r<br/>\r<br/>Timelapse\r<br/>The screen capture stopped working about halfway into Saturday, so the video doesn't show the last several hours of work, sadly.\r<br/>\r<br/>Post-Compo Version\r<br/>This version has a much better difficulty curve and the ability to analyze the bunny population's genome with the &quot;Gene Selector.&quot; Bomb upgrades have also been added in, and you get a random one every 250 kills.\r<br/>\r<br/>The Genes and What They Do\r<br/>Each gene is rated from 0 to 15, 0 being the lowest level of expression, and 15 being the highest level of expression.\r<br/>RED, GRN, BLU : The genes for red, green, or blue fur\r<br/>POW, TUF : POW increases stun resistance and makes the bunnies appear taller, while TUF increases health and makes the bunnies appear wider.\r<br/>SPD, EYE : The genes for speed (evidenced by how quickly they wobble) and eyesight\r<br/>MUT : The higher this gene is rated, the more likely a clone is to have one or more mutations\r<br/>\r<br/>How to Use the Gene Selector\r<br/>Previous/Next Gene: Up/Down Arrow (or W/S)\r<br/>Alter Selection Range : Left/Right Arrow (or A/D)\r<br/>Fine-Tune : Hold Shift Key while altering selection range\r<br/>Reset Ranges : Space Bar\r<br/>Toggle Selection Mode : Tab",

It's got some bugs, couple of things that really hinder the experience including a kinda game-breaking problem, but it is avoidable.\r<br/>Anyway, submitting it now since I don't want to be a loser and postpone for the Jam. :3\r<br/>\r<br/>The theme was Evolution so I took it at its simplest form. \r<br/>\r<br/>In this game you're on an erm... Candy Hill, and you control  a little ball. As you collect various candy you get bigger (you &quot;evolve&quot;), but you are also constantly shrinking, so keep collecting the candy to keep going. You also should be wary to not let the ball get too big, as you will lose if you get to a certain size. (It will say &quot;Warning!&quot; if you're close to losing) You also lose if you let the ball get too small, too, of course. ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>All in all, I'm happy I participated in LD24. Learned a bit, had a lot of fun, didn't sleep (xD), and came out alive with a pretty good little game. Could be much better, yes. Rushed, yes. I will keep working on it and release an enhanced version sooner or later. \r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy, hope you all enjoyed LD24.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Move: Left/Right Arrows\r<br/>Jump: Space/Up\r<br/>Goal: Collect candy to let the ball get larger, don't let it get too big and of course, not too small or you lose. Also, don't collect the evil tomatoes or the ball's size will decrease quite a bit.",

			"htmlDesc": "(UPDATE: A post-LD version of the game with direct real-time online battles against other players can be found at http://vdzserver.org/misc/DIGIEVOV2.RAR . CREATUREs evolved with the LD version can be used in the new version, but not vice versa, and any EXP (or other changes) gained in the new version will be reverted if you play that CREATURE in the original LD version again. To use your old creature, unrar to the same folder or copy the access file. For judging, please use the original version linked in big letters above, rather than the new version.)\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: If problems occur while trying to access the DIGIEVO system, please ensure that the computer trying to access the DIGIEVO system is a Windows PC equipped with the following supporting software:\r<br/>* .NET Framework 4: https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=17851\r<br/>* XNA Framework 4: https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20914\r<br/>\r<br/>Thank you for subscribing to the DIGIEVO system. The DIGIEVO system allows you to EVOLVE a CREATURE to battle other CREATUREs. In order to EVOLVE your CREATURE, you must win battles to gather EXP, then ask other players for the CODE of their CREATUREs. You will then be able to EVOLVE your CREATURE by learning MOVEs and TRAITs of the CREATURE you entered the CODE of.\r<br/>\r<br/>The system has support for battling pre-generated CREATUREs (LOCAL BATTLE), as well as random CREATUREs of other players (RANDOM BATTLE). You can also choose to have friendly battles with other players' creatures through the CUSTOM BATTLE and AUTO BATTLE functions.\r<br/>\r<br/>Feel free to use the messaging system on this page (also known as 'the comments') to share the CODEs of your CREATUREs. For an example of the EVOLUTION system, you can enter the CODE 'TRANSFER FINAL FIRE GRID' to access one of the pre-made DIGIEVO CREATUREs.",

			"htmlDesc": "A puzzle platformer game made in Construct Classic.\r<br/>\r<br/>You are a small orange creature who runs and jumps about the world. Your goal is to find and collect the 5 hidden fallen stars. You can evolve by collecting Red, Blue, Purple, and Green orbs. BUT, you can only evolve 7 times per character. (i.e. you can only collect 7 orbs before having to restart.) You will have to evolve yourself in different ways to get all the stars!\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm very happy I was able to finish my game on my first entry into the competition! I think the thing I struggled most with is teaching or explaining to the player how to play the game, as it can be a tad confusing. I also couldn't think of a more fitting name. Everything else should be fine though. If you get stuck or confused, the help.txt file might be helpful. There's an easter egg hidden somewhere on the map, which shouldn't be to hard to find. Also, there's an ending cinematic if you collect all five stars :) Enjoy!\r<br/>\r<br/>IF THE GAME FREEZES AFTER THE TUTORIAL:\r<br/>I'm sorry this happens. At this point, the game creates and modifies a bunch of objects for the main level, all in one go. If the game freezes, and doesn't crash, try waiting a while. On my computer it only takes about 5 seconds, and on others I've seen it take like 10 or 15 seconds, and that's the only solution I can think of. Maybe you could try waiting a minute or more. Sorry again.\r<br/>\r<br/>I apologize for not being able to port the game to OS/X or Linux, but if you're on a mac you can try Wine. And if the game crashes on Windows, please try to tell me when or what causes the game to crash, and the error message. Thanks a lot.\r<br/>\r<br/>About the source:\r<br/>I'm really sorry, but I do not believe the source of the game is available. I've tried opening it in Construct Classic 0.98.9, r1.1, and r1.2, and it just gives an error of &quot;this game was made in a newer version of construct.&quot; If you really want to see the source, I can send you some backups I made during development, so you could see if those work. Or if you have any questions about the code, I would be happy to explain stuff to you. Just let me know. Also, the source still does contain the graphics and sound effects, so you can still have those if you want them.",

I felt it would be more fitting if I tried to stick to four-six buttons and a small resolution, as I knew the game would be simple.\r<br/>\r<br/>The instructions are ingame this time around, and hopefully somewhat clear. You (the player) take the role of a Monkey about to undergo an experimental procedure to jumpstart the evolution of the Monkeyman race! I am no geneticist nor very familiar with biology; any resemblence to reality or real science is purely coincidence. There isn't any, though, so don't worry.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are five buttons relevant to the game: w, s, f, enter, and escape key. Enter moves forward in the menus, and through the instructions. Escape at any time will exit the game. W/S move up and down the section of the genome presented ingame, and F attempts to replace invalid parts (in red) of the Monkeyman genome with parts of the next stage of Monkeymanity (in green)!\r<br/>\r<br/>If you are too slow to fix the section of the genome shown, you recieve a blast of radiation and the process reverts one stage.\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun!\r<br/>\r<br/>-Andy\r<br/>\r<br/>Ninjaedit: For the Linux version you'll have to do chmod +x on LD24.jar itself and then run it.",

Rest assured that these ARE normal and usually do not interfere with play once the SDL window appears.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is no tutorial right now, so this will require some explanation. \r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS\r<br/>* Move around with wasd. (In the post-compo version, controls have been changed to qweasdzxc to allow diagonal movement. Sorry, non-qwerty people. :( )\r<br/>* Press g and then a direction key to grab in that direction.\r<br/>* Press t and click a slug in your inventory to drop it.\r<br/>* Press m to enter magic mode. While in magic mode, you can eat slugs for mana or click a spell to enter casting mode. While in casting mode, click the world to cast your selected spell. (Note that, as in Magic: The Gathering, ending your turn resets your mana to zero!)\r<br/>* Mouse over a slug or a spell to see its stats.\r<br/>* *** If you get stuck (such as by entering Magic Mode or Drop Mode without any slugs in your inventory), in the post-compo version, you can press escape to end your turn. ***\r<br/>\r<br/>SPELLS:\r<br/>* Lightning: 1 mana. Kills exactly one target slug.\r<br/>* Hand: 5 mana. Puts the target slug in your inventory.\r<br/>* Fire: 10 mana. Kills all slugs in the target square and all adjacent squares.\r<br/>* Dawn (unimplemented): 100 mana. Ascend to godhood and remake the world in your image.\r<br/>\r<br/>STATS\r<br/>* Mana: the amount of mana you receive for eating this slug.\r<br/>* Docility (TAME): the slug's aversion to fights. Slugs with low TAME will frequently kill slugs around them (but not you, for they are lowly slugs and you a mighty Slugmage!)\r<br/>* Perseverance (PERS): the slug's attention span. Slugs with low PERS will frequently switch targets.\r<br/>* Weight (WGHT): currently no effect. Originally, the Slugmage was to have a weight limit, so that slugs would have to be bred for low weight in addition to high mana yield.\r<br/>* In addition, each slug has a color that is derived from its weight (green), docility (red -- low docility means HIGH red!), and mana yield (blue). Slugs with radically differing colors will have trouble mating.\r<br/>\r<br/>MONSTERS\r<br/>Monsters in Slugmage, as lesser beings than yourself, cannot harm you. However, as they are the main source of the mana with which you exert your divine presence, you would do well to learn about them.\r<br/>* Font of Life: actually a type of venerable slug, Fonts give up their mobility in exchange for independence and asexual reproduction. Fonts remain capable of sexual reproduction (but cannot initiate it) and grant renewed life to weary slugs around them.\r<br/>* Slug: a stupid creature that has nothing better to do than chase random other monsters. Slugs require constant rejuvenation from their home font, and will return to it when they begin to shrivel up. Certain slugs with low perseverance may give up their futile chasing altogether to become Fonts.",

			"htmlDesc": "Description:\r<br/>As my first ever submission to Ludum Dare, here is Cocci. In this game you guide a colony of bacteria (initially red [and created as a Brownian tree]) down a tunnel, trying to minimize collisions with the walls (blue) and obstacles (yellow). As you progress, you will unavoidably run into something. When a collision happens, the section of your colony that collided dies, while surviving bacterium mutate and replicate, creating new members. As you continue, the shape of your colony evolves, sometimes helping you avoid obstacles (an advantageous mutation), sometimes making them unavoidable (deleterious mutation).\r<br/>\r<br/>The title of the window tells you how many collisions you've had. The right most number in for the current session. The previous numbers are for previous sessions. A &quot;*&quot; denotes that the session wasn't finished.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Arrow keys move\r<br/>Space starts and resets\r<br/>Escape exits\r<br/>\r<br/>Resources:\r<br/>I used Java, LWJGL, Slick-Util, Eclipse, and Audacity for this project.\r<br/>I started with this base code: http://lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=LWJGL_Basics_3_(The_Quad)\r<br/>I used some code from here for sound:\r<br/>http://lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Slick-Util_Library_-_Part_2_-_Loading_Sounds_for_LWJGL\r<br/>I also reused an old drawCube() method I had written a while ago.\r<br/>If any of this isn't kosher please let me know.\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions:\r<br/>Download/unzip/run Cocci.jar in the folder it's in\r<br/>\r<br/>Notes:\r<br/>I ran the gamut of emotions while making this, from caffeine induced glee to frustration and anxiety that the whole thing would end up terrible. Overall, although it's a bit janky, I'm really happy with how it ended up. Also, save yourself the headache and me the embarrassment and don't look at the source code, it's a tangled horrible mess. Thanks a lot for hosting Ludum Dare!",

But I had fun making it!\r<br/>Winning isn't hard, nor losing, so try to do both at least once. \r<br/>Use the cursor keys.\r<br/>\r<br/>(Edit) Allright it needs more instructions:  \r<br/>Your enemy tries to kill all mutations (she doesn't like them). You can mutate normal lifeforms by touching them with your 'mutator'. If you have mutated all normal lifeforms, your enemy will give up for that time.\r<br/>And yes, it is not always obvious which lifeforms are mutations.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game looks at its best played in the standalone flash player.\r<br/>\r<br/>By the way: I like that the scientist had his eyes closed at the moment I took the screenshot (typical).\r<br/>\r<br/>(EDIT) I've also made a version with build-in help screen. You can press Esc for a popup screen with help. I'm not sure if it is within the rules so I posted it as an post-deadline update.",

There's no sound effects or other blocks or gameplays twists in this version... just what it says on the tin.\r<br/>\r<br/>[EDIT] Known bug on Mac version: if you have Spaces installed, using the Ctrl key to rotate might accidentally cause you to switch desktops. Will fix this in a post-compo build. For now, just use RShift to rotate on Mac to avoid this.\r<br/>\r<br/>[POST COMPO]\r<br/>I noticed that when I play other people's games, they play mine, and a lot of the feedback I've been getting seemed like low-hanging fruits, so I spent a few hours this weekend making an improved version. Feel free to give this one a try after you've played and rated the jam version. \r<br/>\r<br/>Windows: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/19025642/LD24/post-compo/GDrop-Windows.zip\r<br/>Mac: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/19025642/LD24/post-compo/GDrop-Mac.app.zip\r<br/>Linux 32-bit: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/19025642/LD24/post-compo/gdrop-linux-32.tar.gz\r<br/>Linux 64-bit: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/19025642/LD24/post-compo/gdrop-linux-64.tar.gz\r<br/>\r<br/>- Changed the control setup to position the point where the blocks are falling to at the mouse position, so long as that's on the board. This allows for much more precise control than with the keyboard\r<br/>- Eliminated counter-clockwise rotation, as it didn't seem to be adding much on top of clockwise rotation, and..\r<br/>- Replaced that with a tetris-style quick-drop mechanic\r<br/>- Mapped both the rotate and quick drop actions to the mouse right and left buttons, respectively. So everything is on the mouse.\r<br/>- Slowed down the pace of the auto drop\r<br/>- Added a stable square-block configuration, because sometimes you just want to put a block of live squares in the middle of the board\r<br/>- Made the drop shadow translucent\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Thank you all for all of your feedback!

			"htmlDesc": "*Important Update*  Most of the bugs have been worked out, if you had crashes or white textures before those have been fixed now...If you had control issues the keyboard control that was in the debug build for testing is now turned on also, mostly for you trackpad users who don't have a real mouse or a decent nub :P  (I asked PoV and he said it was fine since it was essentialy a &quot;port&quot; to allow slower computers and computers without real mice to play)  Aside from the standard &quot;click to where you want to move&quot; you can also use wasd (sorry non-qwerty keyboard users, this code was never meant for release, it was just a debug thing)\r<br/>\r<br/>The source package also now contains a standard makefile instead of just the codeblocks project, and i've included all the headers and engine shared objects packed with it. (don't need to go to my site and download it anymore)\r<br/>\r<br/>This was built for linux and android, the windows version is a port and my engine is not yet very well tested under windows so there may be some bugs! Please rate the other two versions if possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>the android version may take a few hours to show up in google play as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is a simple action rpg operated entirely by the mouse (linux and windows) or touch (android).  Kill enemies and you will start to evolve parts of your body into parts of theirs (don't kill too many blobs or you'll be stuck a blob for a long time!)  Parts can freely mix and match.\r<br/>\r<br/>See if you can survive and make it to the end!  (There IS an end, and it will be obvious when you see it that you need to go there)\r<br/>\r<br/>Quick Evolution Tips:\r<br/>* Fighting a single enemy too much has the potential to de-evolve traits you have gotten from other enemies\r<br/>* There are three &quot;visible&quot; traits in your evolution, head, body, and back.  Body in general determines your base defense and attack speed, head determines your base damage and range, back(wings) lets you fly at different speeds depending on wing type\r<br/>* everything has a tradeoff, for instance a heavy body like the wolfrat has higher defense but will be slower than a lightweight bird body,\r<br/>* there are more &quot;invisible&quot; traits, that unfortunately i did not have time to sprite.  Legs provide a speed boost and can be obtained from any creature that has them (bird,wolf,spider). The bird legs are slow but faster than having none (blob), wolf is fast and spider is fastest.\r<br/>* the second &quot;invisible&quot; trait is skin type, you start as &quot;naked&quot; type which has no stat changes at all (blob is essentially &quot;pure&quot; no modifiers on all stats), you can evolve hair from wolves, scales from snakes, and feathers from birds, hair has a minor defense bonus, scales has a major defense bonus, and feathers has a speed bonus.  Again, they ARE there you just cant see them due to time constraints cutting my spriting short.\r<br/>* the third invisible property is venom sacs, you either have them or not, you can evolve them from either spider or snake DNA, they cuase enemies to harm themselves when they attempt to attack you after you've hit them at least once\r<br/>* the last invisible property is the bat's echolocation, which brightens up the rooms, this is only obtainable by bats and is the only property that CANT de-evolve once you have it\r<br/>\r<br/>Overall there are 36 unique body combinations for your creature that are visible (modular sprites, it mixes and matches them based on your current statistics), in all there are 2304  different combinations of abilities so how you play and what you attack and in what order can have a very VERY drastic effect on how the game plays for you.",
