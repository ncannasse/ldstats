You send boats to attack the other team islands, or to assist your own islands.\r<br/>\r<br/>Avoid the whirlpool.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you like it.\r<br/>\r<br/>Mac users should use the webstart version.\r<br/>Firefox in Linux usually hangs while downloading but it resumes after download complete.\r<br/>In any case, if you have problemas you should try the Webstart version as it is more compatible.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE: \r<br/>  * Fixed bug: an island could go into negative number of units.\r<br/>  * Added support for Mac.\r<br/>",

Once your world has finished generating, click on the tile with the flag on it. From here, you can create more villagers.

Simply press the corresponding button that pops up.\r<br/>3. IMPORTANT: Your villagers require constant sustenance. Keep a close eye on your food and water supplies, or your people will die! *** The only way to get food is to create a farm (from the bottom of the screen)\r<br/>4. So you've got some villagers now. Awesome. Now look at the top right of the screen. You should see numbers like &quot;1/3/10&quot; The first number is the number of villagers _working_. The second is the total number of villagers, and the third is how many villagers you can create.\r<br/>5. Oops you've hit your population cap? At the bottom of the screen you can click the house and click a tile to place it (must be empty, as with all others). Note that you can only have up to 250 villagers.\r<br/>6.

I meant to add more HQ's you could build so you could have closer places for villagers to collect from, but I didn't have time to put that in.\r<br/>\r<br/>When you assign a villager to gather a resource, it will actually walk across the tiles (albeit invisibly) to its destination, gather some of the resource, and head back.\r<br/>Bugs:\r<br/>1. The villagers aren't chosen closest to the destination. You may have 1 town closer to a resource, but another town's villager might wander over.\r<br/>2.

			"htmlDesc": "I took sort of a weird approach to the theme, and based it more on the unconscious significance of islands then on islands themselves. There is an Island, its even a fairly important part of the game, both in gameplay and in premise, that being said, there is also a much larger metaphorical island.\r<br/>\r<br/>It plays somewhere in between NiGHTs and any good old fashioned treasure shootem up.\r<br/>\r<br/>Sense the tutorial text kinda jumps by sometimes, I guess Ill just post controlls. Move with the arrow keys, fairly straight forward there, double tap a direction to dash attack. Dash attacking into an enemy kills it (or at least hurts it,) and gives you a glowing aura. You can use that aura to figure out how close you are to the objective (blue = really far away, red = close) There are three levels, kind of, even tho they are all the same, just with more enemies that move slightly faster. You get some plot between levels, and then the DRAMATIC PLOT TWIST at the end. Its kind of a depressing game. Sorry. You also will fire a huge spread of projectiles that home in on enemy's if you dash attack enough. These frequently end up killing offscreen enemies and giving you randomly awesome kill combo multipliers. THIS IS A FEATURE! NOT A BUG!... okay, well, maybe its a bug.\r<br/>\r<br/>The For loop that builds the level is kinda broken (actually, the whole level building part is kinda broken...) so it takes a second to load the playstate, just bare with it, it (probably) didnt crash.\r<br/>This needs some hardcore optimizations to be totally honest, but its still pretty fun, and this was a totally new experience for me. (I have all of one other game under my belt, and have only been learning actionscript and flixel for a few months...)\r<br/>\r<br/>Oh... code note, I made this in flash develop using flex 3.4 and flixel v2.34.\r<br/>I used some vst stuff, fruity loops, an old midi man keyboard, a simmons sd7k drumset, and an old epiphone guitar for the soundtrack. This includes the sound fx. I was trying to get all of the audio to blend together and create a really surreal feel, and Im fairly happy with it. I wish I could have synched the piano to the text better, but ala's flash is balls for handling sound.\r<br/>The graphics where all drawn in Graphics Gale, mostly with the pencil tool, although I did cheat and let code do some of the work for me (like the water is actually just a 32x32 square that gets re sized to make waves...)\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyhow, Enjoy.

However, if you touch the horde, then you die! You may also see other islanders fighting off zombies - they're great distractions!\r<br/>\r<br/>Move with the arrow keys.\r<br/>Punch and kick with Z and X.\r<br/>Jump by pressing Z and X simultaneously.\r<br/>Double tap an arrow to run.\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy!\r<br/>\r<br/>Uses Java with Java Webstart (all Java-enabled OS's should be able to run it).

Open the menu with A, choose a 'designation' and build it. The rescources needed for whatever you're building is listed in the menu, so bring those rescources to the 'designation' and either use (A) or drop (Down + D) them in front of the designation.

Or a lose screen. When either of these situations arise, you may press R to restart.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, if the random map generator gives you a stupid map, feel free to restart.\r<br/>I'll probably be making a postcompo version that has a lot more polish and works without as many minor hiccups. Also, optimizing.\r<br/>\r<br/>In response to questions that I assume are being asked in secret: You are blue. Fire does not hurt units, it is merely an indicator of hurt. There is no point in owning a colony other than feeling powerful. If you do not build any merchants at the beginning, you will probably fail. If a colony is inland it is useless.\r<br/>\r<br/>The source can be run with the crossplatform Love engine, which is a very small download at http://love2d.org/download\r<br/>To view the source files: the .love file is actually a .zip file, and can be renamed and opened as such.\r<br/>\r<br/>Some aspects of the game are not very optimized, and so it may run slowly on weaker/older machines.

About islands.\r<br/>\r<br/>Objective:\r<br/>\r<br/>The object is to keep the island of Guam from capsizing for as long as possible. You accumulate points over time - more points the more stuff is on the island. Stuff will be air dropped whether you like it or not; you can call in a new building by left-clicking, or a soldier by right-clicking. You lose points if a soldier drowns, and the game ends when the island capsizes.\r<br/>\r<br/>Wish List:\r<br/>\r<br/>There was supposed to be more, like ordering soldiers to build or destroy buildings, or build flotation devices, but, I couldn't get there in time. There was also supposed to be a song, but I didn't allot enough time to learn to use GarageBand - if you sit at the title screen long enough, you can hear some of the samples I was going to use.\r<br/>\r<br/>Known Bugs:\r<br/>There's a bug with the soldiers where when they drown, they still move around, oops. This can lead to them 'drowning' over and over again, and you losing points for it each time. Ah, well.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Left click drops a building, right click a soldier.

Your goal is the chart as many of of these islands as you can without crashing or running out of supplies. Additional detail is inside the included readme.txt.\r<br/>\r<br/>Update About Graphics\r<br/>It has come to my attention that the the game is not scaling up properly on some machines. This makes the graphics look extremely blurry, rather than blocky, which was the intent. This may have something to do with XP vs 7; I developed on 7, where it looks fine, but when tried on an XP machine, looked blurry. The game is still playable with the blurry graphics, it just doesn't look good at all (not that it looked &quot;good&quot; to start with, but you get me). As I alluded in my release notes below, I'm pretty much unavailable today (Sunday), so this is not something I'll be able to even try to fix. That's the problem with cutting an already short development time in half: little to no time spent testing or bug-fixing. I fully expect to be harshly down-graded by anyone who plays with the blurry graphics, as I should be. I suppose I'll have to chalk this one up to &quot;lessons learned&quot; and do better the next time. Sorry!\r<br/>\r<br/>Notes\r<br/>Made using Game Maker 8. My first time using it actually, though I have used previous versions in the past. I'm actively trying to learn some other game programming, namely C#/XNA and Objective-C/Cocos2D, but those are a long ways away from being something I enter any sort of competition with. This is my second LD attempt, with Caverns being the first. I was not even close to properly prepared for that one in retrospect; I didn't even start Friday night, and goofed around a bit on Saturday, before realizing Sunday morning that I was in trouble. I wound up with about a 66% completed game that was about 33% of my original vision. I wanted to really try at the next one, but after months of waiting, I gut punched when I found out that Exploration was taking place on the weekend I was moving. Arg!\r<br/>\r<br/>But hey, there's always next time right? Believe it or not, I was screwed again: this weekend, I had to fly out mid-day Sunday for business over the next couple of days. Unbelievable! I swear that four out of five weekends, I just hang around the house with nothing special to do. But for some reason, LD conspires against me. I was all set to skip out yet again, when I decided, screw it, I'm going to at least TRY. I scaled back all ideas I had to the bare minimum possible: an Atari-esque arcade game. Something with no music, leaves-plenty-to-the-imagination graphics, play time of under a minute, and so on. And I made it! In retrospect, the game is actually incredibly basic for the amount of time I spent on it - I have a feeling the more experienced people on here could whip this thing out in hours, rather than a full day - but hey, everyone's got to start somewhere, eh?",

			"htmlDesc": "Lonesome Flotsam\r<br/>Ludum Dare 17 version by Caleb Jewett\r<br/>\r<br/>Get ready to fight for survival! It's your job to control a lifeform so overgrown with hair it is practically unrecognizable. Your good friend, the protagonist, is so filled with fright that she? he? it? can not be left alone for an instant without spinning into a crazed, whirling insanity. You'll have to take the lead.\r<br/>\r<br/>Scour the landscape for blueprints and materials to give you and your friend the tools to survive and, perhaps, even escape. Sample the local delicacies: crab and purple boar. If you can gather enough wood to build a raft, you might, MIGHT be able to see home again. Or, you might be forced to face an awful truth.\r<br/>\r<br/>WASD to attack.\r<br/>Arrow keys to move.\r<br/>Use the mouse in the workshop.\r<br/>Get at least 20 trees and the raft blueprints to build a raft, escape, and win the game! ...maybe...\r<br/>\r<br/>1.1 VERSION:\r<br/>I think I fixed the permanent invulnerability bug, I added a second workshop and some boars to make hunting easier, I fixed a room change bug, and renamed some stuff. Also, the good ending now requires armor. I don't think either ending is accessible in the LD17 version due to bugs :(.\r<br/>\r<br/>1.2 Changes:\r<br/>The new workshop actually works! It should no longer kill you!\r<br/>Raft recipe moved so it is visible and obtainable.\r<br/>Your conscience may rest more easily: boars will no longer moan so loudly when you \r<br/>kill them.\r<br/>Continues added by popular demand! Please don't tell the wilderness protection\r<br/>officials, they will ruin things for all of us.\r<br/>\r<br/>I named this game after a song I made. You can hear the chiptune version of it here: http://8bitcollective.com/music/Pyrrhuloxia/Lonesome+Flotsam+%288+Bit+Remix%29/\r<br/>\r<br/>Really hope someone manages to finish, so I've updated to 1.2!",

This has no gameplay effect, but looks cool.\r<br/>* The kobold is a character from an earlier game I made, Dragondot, in case you're wondering what that's about.\r<br/>* I'm in technical violation of a submission guideline. The &quot;death poof&quot; sound in this game is the same sound kobolds make when they die in Dragondot, as an inside joke/continuity nod.

			"htmlDesc": "Arks of Mercy\r<br/>=============\r<br/>\r<br/>A Ludum Dare #17 entry by Noe Falzon (Tenoch)\r<br/>&lt;firstname.lastname@aliceadsl.fr&gt;\r<br/>\r<br/>Be the savior of an endangered nation, as the level of the waters rise ineluctably. Guide your people to the safest mountains, build boats, teleportation towers and mighty shelters before it is too late!\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: tiny post-deadline bugfix. Archives have been updated. If you want to (and you should) judge the pre-deadline version, just assume the game would crash when trying to select a non completed ark =) Thanks to allen and Almost for reporting it!\r<br/>\r<br/>How to run\r<br/>----------\r<br/>\r<br/>Windows: double-click arks_of_mercy.bat, or similar. You can change the window size by editing the .bat files or creating your own.\r<br/>\r<br/>GNU/Linux: run arks_of_mercy.sh (depending on your file manager, double clicking on it might be enough). You will need the following libraries: Lua 5.1, SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_gfx, SDL_ttf.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can modify this file to change the window size (especially if the game doesn't run at the first try). For instance, replace the contents with:\r<br/>\r<br/>lua main.lua 800 600\r<br/>or\r<br/>lua main.lua 1024 768 fullscreen\r<br/>\r<br/>(or run these commands directly...)\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls\r<br/>--------\r<br/>\r<br/>The game was designed to be used with a gamepad (I have a DualShock clone), but provides keyboard replacements as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>D-pad/Arrows : move\r<br/>Left and right shoulders / S and F : rotate camera\r<br/>Left and right triggers / E and D : zoom in and out\r<br/>Cross / Spacebar : bring menu, select, action, etc.\r<br/>Circle / G : cancel\r<br/>\r<br/>And shortcuts, without which it is still possible to play:\r<br/>Square / R : place beacon\r<br/>Triangle / T : place boat\r<br/>\r<br/>Now of course, all gamepads have different numbering systems and that kind of stuff, and since there is no ingame keymapper, you'll have to modify the file keymap.lua. It should be mostly self explanatory. You can of course modify the default keys as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>Additional keys, mostly for fun:\r<br/>\r<br/>1: toggle wireframe\r<br/>2: toggle land color\r<br/>3: print FPS rate\r<br/>4: while held, water raises a lot faster\r<br/>Escape: quit instantly\r<br/>\r<br/>Gameplay\r<br/>--------\r<br/>\r<br/>The inhabitants of this small world are pretty dumb. They will wander randomly, and only flee the water when it is really close. But they can get trapped on islands and die tragically there when the water comes, which is why you need to guide them.\r<br/>\r<br/>1. Beacons\r<br/>\r<br/>Place a beacon above the land by bringing the menu and chosing the weird four-piked item, or alternatively, by pressing &quot;place beacon&quot;. The circle around it is its area of influence. Guys in it will be attracted to the beacon.\r<br/>\r<br/>To remove a beacon, place the cursor close to it and press &quot;beacon&quot; or &quot;action&quot; (shortcuts come in handy when objects are close to each other).\r<br/>\r<br/>Note that you have a limited number of beacons at the same time on the map. When the limit is reached, the first ones will disapear.\r<br/>\r<br/>2. Boats\r<br/>\r<br/>Create a boat on the sea by bringing the menu and chosing the flat round item, or alternatively, by pressing &quot;place boat&quot;.\r<br/>\r<br/>Pressing &quot;action&quot; near the boat will bring its own menu, with three items: load, unload, destroy.\r<br/>Chose load, move the cursor to a land zone with people, and press &quot;action&quot;. The boat will start moving towards the goal, and when it arrives, all the people within the area of influence indicated when aiming will try to board the boat.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are only 10 places on a boat.\r<br/>\r<br/>Unloading works the same. Sometimes the boat will not unload, because the terrain is not safe, try again seconds later, or further away.\r<br/>\r<br/>Delete, well, deletes the boat, including its passengers.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is also a limited number of boats, but the first ones won't be automatically deleted. Instead, the &quot;boat&quot; item will not show up in the menu.\r<br/>Sometimes the guys are really dumb and throw themselves to the sea while trying to board the ship. Oh well...\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>3. Teleportation towers\r<br/>\r<br/>The third item in the menu, tall pyramid with four legs, is a teleportation tower. Place it on the ground, like a beacon. Note that it takes some time to build. You can cancel its creation by bringing up its menu and chosing the delete item.\r<br/>\r<br/>Once built, a new item will appear in its menu: linking to another tower. Chose it, move near another tower, and press &quot;action&quot;. Note that the towers must be in line of sight. A red line (instead of the lightnings) indicate non line of sight.\r<br/>\r<br/>Once linked to another tower, a new item appears: calling people. All the people in a close range around the tower will enter it, and reappear outside the linked tower. Use in conjunction with a beacon to attract people as close as possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note that you are limited to 4 towers. Note also that the links are one way. If you can explicitly make to towers point at each other, it is in no way mandatory. You can make a network, or a chain, or anything you like. Remember also that you can change the target by selecting again the link item.\r<br/>\r<br/>4. Arks\r<br/>\r<br/>The ultimate shelter. The boats are safe, but they contain only a few people. To save your entire population, you need to build these huge floating cities. Each shelter can hold 100 persons.\r<br/>\r<br/>You are not limited in the number of shelters you build.\r<br/>Beware, the construction is not automatic like teleport towers. The construction speed is proportionnal to the number of people close to the ark! Use beacons to attract people really close!\r<br/>\r<br/>Once built, the ark's menu contains one option: making the close people embark. You cannot destroy an ark, or unload its passengers.\r<br/>\r<br/>Once the water reaches the ark, it will start floating to safety!\r<br/>\r<br/>5. Victory?\r<br/>\r<br/>There is no winning or losing condition. The aim is to save as many people as possible. The game stops when all the people are either dead, or rescued.\r<br/>\r<br/>During the game, you can check your advance by bringing up the menu. The numbers shown are the people still in need of rescue, and the people rescued. The game always starts at 500.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>License\r<br/>-------\r<br/>\r<br/>The source code is under GNU GPL v3.\r<br/>Music and graphics are cc-by-nc-sa.\r<br/>\r<br/>GNU/Linux notes:\r<br/>----------------\r<br/>\r<br/>The game comes with a precompiled binary (evolcore.so) created on a Ubuntu system. If it doesn't work on your particular distribution, compile evolcore.c into a shared library evolcore.so, linked against the libraries mentioned earlier. You can use the provided SConstruct, if you have the scons building system installed.\r<br/>",

The AI takes up a huge portion of my code, so it's an absolute nightmare to debug, I tell you. I play it and I say, &quot;Hold up a minute, it's supposed to be ____ing!&quot; and I proceed to change a line or two. &quot;Great, it's doing that now, but not ____!!&quot; -- so exciting.\r<br/>\r<br/>44 hours after deadline: Made a small AI tweak (it was previously ceasing to purchase more people once the population hit ~500, leading the player to an irritatingly easy victory) one item now costs $100 more as an improvement to balance, and fixed a typo in one of the help messages. Also, the easiest AI setting is now just a smidgen more difficult than before.",

You play as a jealous volcanic island god, who must blow up the other gods that you encounter.\r<br/>\r<br/>What went right:\r<br/>\r<br/>A friend inspired me to come up with what I thought was a pretty good idea.  Everybody I passed it across said they liked it.  After wasting a few hours agonizing over the theme, I was able to start work on what should have been a solid game.\r<br/>\r<br/>All of the levels of the game (3 in total, LOL) are playable.\r<br/>\r<br/>What went wrong:\r<br/>\r<br/>Well, first of all, Mother Nature took up almost half a day from me due to very bad storms (torandos and hail!)  After that, I was back on track, but then I decided to take a break at the beginning of my second day.  And that break stretched in around 6 hours of goofing off.\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm still pretty new to Actionscript 3/Flixel, so I spent a lot of time digging through Flixel/AS3 internals to figure out how I wanted to do stuff.  That cost a fair amount of time.\r<br/>\r<br/>I didn't have a good testing regime too.\r<br/>\r<br/>Gameplay isn't fleshed out.  You need a way to deflect the incoming fireballs.  I was going to have unused mana power a shield, but ran out of time to implement it.",

You need the Unity Web Player, a keyboard and a mouse.  Move with WASD, inventory is 1234, E to use, and mouse to look around.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please comment!  I'm still new to this and some constructive criticism would go a long way.\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT 1 : Reuploaded the correct version, where it's possible to win.\r<br/>EDIT 2 : Fixed bugs where you couldn't die and some graphical glitches.  Also there's seagulls now in the title.\r<br/>EDIT 3 : Source is up now in a .unitypackage  Not sure if I did this right... if there's any problems please let me know.  Important note: there is profanity everywhere.\r<br/>EDIT LAST ONE I PROMISE : For some reason I didn't think that music would be considered game content and should be original as well.  When somebody pointed this out, I quickly jumped on ToneMatrix and threw one together.  I'll leave the old version with Brother Android up as &quot;Unity (Web) OLD&quot; so you can play that one too, but the new one has a song I made.  Sorry!\r<br/>The old song was Brother Android - The Stars come out. http://8bitcollective.com/members/Brother+Android/",

If you just click the love.exe you will get a tank. That is not the game.

			"htmlDesc": "My first Ludum Dare and I end up with a pokemon game ... Well this is suppose to turn out just great.\r<br/>\r<br/>You know the feeling that you've just got enough of pokemon? I had the feeling years ago and it has not ended! So now is the time to go out for the greater good and destroy those beasts! I won't say it will be easy but I believe in you doing it! I have big expectations for you, good sir!\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyways - the principle is simple and you just have to sail to Islands, kill pokemons, sell their skin, buy more ammo, kill more pokemons (and yes, the game will end).\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls are simple and you use arrows to sail ship. Escape to leave shop. Numbers for the res but it is explained during game.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is a windows, linux32 and linux64 executable so no reasons not to try it dudes - took some effort to get the windows one though.\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you'll enjoy it - I've at least enjoyed making it :)\r<br/>\r<br/>// Sune\r<br/>\r<br/>Ps. This game has theme song - you can hear it as long as you have the 3 introducing slides so take it easy on those ;)!\r<br/>\r<br/>Pps. I have tried to cross-compile it to windows - which was not easy - but it seems like there is a small problem - instead of detecting the sides as wall it just shuts down - I haven't been able to fix it as I have not clue of why it's happening -_- Also there's some weird exits in Windows but it's really unexplainable but it works most of the time :)\r<br/>\r<br/>***********************************************************\r<br/>Written in C++ with SDL bindings and use of SDL_mixer and SDL_ttf\r<br/>***********************************************************\r<br/>\r<br/>Checked the links - should work just fine\r<br/>\r<br/>***********************************************************\r<br/>\r<br/>Found I had to upload the source so here it is - it ended up like crap due to my lack of overview and more than microchip programming ... Anyways - enjoy if you want to read it and sorry for it wasn't uploaded in the beginning - didn't know I was suppose too :)",

Each package scores you 10 hunks of food that you must hurl with a questionable amount of accuracy towards the food storage bins on each island.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Press the SPACEBAR to toss savory goodness into the air, and hope that it lands in a box and not in the water or against the face of a starving castaway.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Each food item that lands in a storage box earns you 1 point.\r<br/>\r<br/>- You can earn BANKSHOT bonuses by bouncing food off a castaway's head and making it land in a box. This is usually by complete accident, but you can lie and say that you did it on purpose.\r<br/>\r<br/>- The castaways are insatiable. They will beg for food until they die. Notice that they never eat it. They just beg for it. There is no use in trying to please them. Just worry about your score. It's what matters most in this world.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Killing a castaway will cost you 25 points. Every castaway that is left alive when you complete the run will earn you 25 points.\r<br/>\r<br/>- You are judged on your food tossing accuracy at the end of your run, and you are given a bonus multiplier to reflect your (lack of) skill.\r<br/>\r<br/>- There is only 1 'stage', and the only objective is to earn points by any means necessary.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Oh, and press ENTER to start the game when on the title screen, and again at the results screen to reset.\r<br/>\r<br/>- F4 goes into full screen mode\r<br/>\r<br/>- HAVE FUN!",

Help him to explore his surroundings and, hopefully, find a way off the island. The game autosaves every time you reach a checkpoint and every time you die too.\r<br/>\r<br/>(No, he can't swim. The game wouldn't be very challenging if he could.)\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: Second bugfix update (the first bugfix accidentally reverted to a previous version, which made the game work even worse than before :D ). It should work perfectly now. Again, if you experience graphical oddities press &quot;Q&quot; to deactivate the grass effects.\r<br/>\r<br/>Source requires Game Maker and only runs on Windows.\r<br/>\r<br/>To those who are stuck on the final level, take a look at this video walkthrough:\r<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x58LUilwRk",

It may work with Moonlight on Linux but is untested as of yet.\r<br/>\r<br/>Important: If you are playing the original version and the queen asks you to get her 5000 gold coins reload. You will never finish!\r<br/>\r<br/>The premise is that you are a ship captain that the Queen tasks to get a certain number of items (It is random). You must sail between the islands to obtain the requested number of items to win the game. Pirates will attempt to steal your cargo so you must also stock cannons and swords to fight them with.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is a strategy guide posted here: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2010/04/28/strategy-guide-for-voyage-for-the-queen/\r<br/>\r<br/>The game was written using Visual Studio and Silverlight. It is using the WriteableBitmapEx library for blitting. Photoshop was used for the graphics.\r<br/>\r<br/>The bugfix version has the following fixes. The original is also in a link above for the purists:\r<br/>\r<br/>*Pirates who manage to get through both cannon and sword defenses will now steal all your stuff rather than just saying they did.\r<br/>*The queen will now not select coins or cannons for the quest as they were problematic.\r<br/>*Pirates can no longer show up with negative number of swords and cannons.\r<br/>*Removed exploit where player could get out of a pirate battle by hitting the X on the window.",

The theme was islands, and the point of this game is to guide your boats (golden ones) to battle against the evil black boats. You can do this by controlling the elements of nature! Left click to create a ripple in water, and right click to change wind direction. Boats will battle each other automatically. Oh and there's islands. The total work on this is aproximately 8 hours since I was working all weekend, I couldn't get more in. It's far from polished, and the code is ugly, but I plan on making a more elaborate version later on. Oh and I ripped the idea off from there: http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=77\r<br/>\r<br/>If it's worth anything, this was my first Ludum Dare.\r<br/>\r<br/>Contact me if you want at alex.turpin@gmail.com",

The bots detonate themselves after a while taking a piece of your island with them. The bots have blinking indicators which will tell you how close they are to blowing up. If your islands integrity falls under 30% it will collapse and the game is over. Falling down from the island will also result in instant failure. Hold on as long as you can to get the highest score. \r<br/>\r<br/>Code\r<br/>\r<br/>Made the game with Flash/AS3. It's the first game I've made with as3 and was a nice crashcourse for moving from as2 to as3. \r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Random rambling\r<br/>\r<br/>Getting sort of burned out at the moment so I think I won't be making any sounds for the game. Tried making some music but after a while gave up on it since I couldn't put anything decent together.\r<br/>It would have been nicer to make the tiles 16x16 so the destruction of the island would have probably looked better but meh. Too tired to start fixing it now.\r<br/>All in all I'm pretty happy what I managed to do in this short time. ",

No^Man is inspired by Today I Die.\r<br/>2.    There are 3 areas with puzzles and a final area that ties off loose ends.\r<br/>3.  If you get stuck on the second puzzle, remember that you can drag words AND items.  Also, the second puzzle only needs one word to be changed.  Disregard the second red word.  You Can't Always Fix A Broken Heart.\r<br/>4.  Don't jump into the the simple looking blue stuff or the simple looking red stuff.  Those are  water and lava respectively and both will kill you, Also Respectively.\r<br/>5.  Sure, you can cheat.  But, you have to live with knowing that you've left the world as bad off as it was when you got there.  Remember, No Man Is An Island.\r<br/>6.  Words can be dangerous.  If you happen to hit your character with a word with enough force, it's entirely possible that he will clip through the earth and die.  Keep This In Mind While You Are Playing.\r<br/>\r<br/>I didn't have time to write code that returned you to the beginning when you fall, so if you happen to fall off, hit escape and start over.

Very hard to make a profit, and, as has been pointed out in the comments, getting robbed is essentially game over. Better balance is definitely priority #1 for the post-Ludum version... I hope you won't be TOO harsh in the voting out of frustration.\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE 2: I didn't know that submitting source was obligatory. I'm submitting now, but didn't keep a copy of the non-LD version. About two hours of work has gone into this since the end of LD, so don't accuse me of cheating if you decide to compile the source and discover it's significantly less buggy and more fun than the compiled LD version.",

This game is also incomplete in a lot of ways, and seems to be buggy, but I didn't have time to fix it! Probably because I spent most of my time slacking off as I didn't really like the theme that much. Anyways, hope you enjoy somewhat idling while waiting to get more attack in the game!\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions:\r<br/>\r<br/>*The land you own is blue. You can click on it to select it, and anything you can attack will turn red.\r<br/>*When you attack something, you'll attack it by ((your attack power - 1) divided by 2).\r<br/>*You will be able to see more of the island as you take over more ground\r<br/>*Normal land will get + 1 every 15 seconds, while big land will get + 2.\r<br/>\r<br/>Resources aren't yet finished, and even if they were, you wouldn't be able to do anything with them. You also can't transfer troops from land to land, so this probably makes the game impossible in this state! Anyways, that pretty much covers it. Have fun!\r<br/>\r<br/>Note: The game is SUPER SIZE. Hope this doesn't affect your gameplay, but it probably will!",

I still have a lot more tweaks to try but I have a sociology paper to write, so this will have to do until I get some more time.\r<br/>\r<br/>IMPORTANT: While in mid-air, the direction you're looking affects your trajectory. So if you need to jump a bit further aim up, or if you're going to overshoot an island aim down. It takes a bit of getting used to, but I think (hope...) it's fairly intuitive. (in the updated version this effect is toned down a bit, but still present)\r<br/>\r<br/>Okay, this is &quot;Island Hopping&quot;, a first person platformer-ish thing (with islands!).\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal is to jump from island to island getting as many points as possible without falling into the water (different islands give different points and there are also various powerups and bonuses).\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls are simply mouse to look and space to jump (you automatically move forward in the direction the camera is looking). The islands are placed procedurally.\r<br/>\r<br/>As time goes by your speed will increase and the islands will become further apart, higher difficulty modes accelerate this process (in addition to spawning smaller islands).\r<br/>\r<br/>See the readme for more specific info.\r<br/>\r<br/>Here's a video of it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUY9C67HARc\r<br/>\r<br/>Here's the timelapse:\r<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sGcEMPxATM\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE: Thanks for the feedback so far! I'm definitely going to keep working on this for a couple weeks, so I'll tweak the difficulty a bit more, allow you to turn off the music (it is pretty repetitive...), add online high scores (I almost have this working right now...) and whatever else I can.",

			"htmlDesc": "Island Towers is a very typical tower defense game. The goal in the game is to prevent fish from reaching the open sea.\r<br/>\r<br/>The fish spawn from the top left corner and try to get to the bottom right corner using the shortest possible path. Islands can be created to make their journey longer and more difficult. Towers can be built on top of the islands to actually kill them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Islands can be created and towers can be built using the left mouse button. There's only one type of tower, but it can be upgraded multiple times. Islands can be sold using the right mouse button.\r<br/>\r<br/>As the game is rather simple, I made it quite hard to even get the highest upgraded tower. As in almost all tower defense games, it matters a lot where you build your towers and which towers you upgrade.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's a 3D game and the camera can be freely moved and rotated (although there's not much need for it).\r<br/>\r<br/>I used 3ds Max to create the models and Paint Shop Pro for the textures. The game is written in C++ and OGRE is used for the rendering. The Windows download link has sources included. The source link contains only the sources.\r<br/>\r<br/>This was my first time entering Ludum Dare and I'm happy that I got at least something done. I'm happy with how the game looks as I'm no artist and I think I did good for myself. But the gameplay is too simple. It would've needed at least a freezing tower or something like that. I should've taken some time away from other things. I used about 19 hours in total including planning and this little documentation. It was a bit less than I had intended, though life rarely goes as planned :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit: I had originally planned on having both direct3d and opengl options but on one case the game would crash even before the choosing dialog if direct3d option was enabled. Then I just commented it out in the plugins file. Now I re-enabled it since I guess it causes less problems that way. It can be disabled just by commenting (or removing) the direct3d line in bin/plugins-windows.cfg\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit2: Ok sorry for the crashing. Seems there was a bug with fish speed normalization. In a very special case a fish might have a zero speed which resulted in division by zero which later on led to crashing. Hopefully the game won't crash anymore :)\r<br/>\r<br/>@Endurion: I am here for the first time, but at least in the submission rules it says &quot;After the deadline, we do allow bugfixes. You're allowed to fix any bugs that stop a player from playing or finishing your game&quot;. The two fixed I have done changed nothing in how the game works, it just shouldn't crash anymore. I could include the previous version too, but there's really nothing different except you're not allowed to choose d3d and it often crashes while playing.",

The engine has zero game logic, it's all in script so it wouldn't matter.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've now updated the Uncompressed link with that containing the uncompressed exe PLUS the actual released data set.. and I've properly beat myself about the head for my stupidity.. perhaps next LD I'll actually release something without any bugger ups!\r<br/>\r<br/>== UPDATE 2 ==\r<br/>\r<br/>== UPDATE ==\r<br/>\r<br/>I've added an uncompressed Win32 binary release as some virus scanners have been throwing hissy fits. I can only assume this is due to running the binary through UPX to compress it.\r<br/>\r<br/>If there are any other issues, please let me know :)\r<br/>\r<br/>== UPDATE ==\r<br/>\r<br/>The one mega zip contains all data, an AMD64 Linux binary and a Win32 binary.\r<br/>\r<br/>Engine source changes shall be up shortly once I get it committed to the branch. -- edit: They're up now, you can browse here: http://www2.xp-dev.com/sc/browse/42754/ or grab direct from SVN: http://svn2.xp-dev.com/svn/stuckie-SGZEngine/\r<br/>\r<br/>Reposting the ReadMe here ( it's a ReadMe for a reason ;) )\r<br/>\r<br/>YARGH! - Shake Yer Booty!\r<br/>=========================\r<br/>\r<br/>It's not quite complete.. there's a number of things missing but I've spent most of this weekend fighting with my engine and chasing obscure list bugs, sadly.\r<br/>I'm releasing as is; there's still a lot there and it's amusing to see just how vicious the computer can actually be at times.\r<br/>It's sheer bedlam!\r<br/>Feel free to fiddle with the scripts as well ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>I did atleast fix the bug that they'd go and absolutely destroy all the forts and mines immediately after starting ;)\r<br/>Granted, you can't pillage the mines or forts ( it refused to pick up the buttons for some reason ) but hopefully this'll be a quick fix later.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've enjoyed this Ludum Dare.. it's been a fun game to work on :)\r<br/>Engine issues aside, of course...\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, brief controls:\r<br/>Left Click on your ship to select it.\r<br/>Right Click moves it.\r<br/>Arrow Keys or moving the mouse to the edge of the screen pans the camera.\r<br/>\r<br/>While a unit is selected:\r<br/>Hold LEFT Control and Right click an enemy unit to attack it.\r<br/>Hold LEFT Shife and Right click on the ground to board/disembark from a ship ( depending on whether you're controlling a ship or man at the time )\r<br/>\r<br/>Apologies that I didn't get this finished as much as I'd have liked...\r<br/>And I shall say the usual - I'll try and continue it where possible!\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you at least enjoy wandering around and seeing the computer cause mayhem ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>Oh, and you can change the screen resolution in the data/scripts/config.sgz ( just a text file )\r<br/>640x480 is a bit cramped, 1024x768 was what it was developed in, but I'm sure you can ramp it up if you like.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks :)\r<br/>Steven Campbell",

			"htmlDesc": "Hi all,\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my Ludum Dare entry. It is an interactive fiction game entitled Islands Far Away.\r<br/>\r<br/>It is a game about a game programmer entering Ludum Dare and trying to create a game about islands.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you haven't tried interactive fiction, I urge you to try it. This is not the typical text adventure. I think it should take about 15-30 minutes to finish. There is dark humor, strong language, and toilet humor. I would probably give this game an R rating if it was a movie, just to warn you.\r<br/>\r<br/>Geeks and programmers should at least identify with some of it and hopefully will enjoy it as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>It will run on any browser that supports javascript:\r<br/>\r<br/>[EDIT: better link: supports ipad, etc]\r<br/>http://parchment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/parchment.html?story=http%3A//www.bitjets.com/islands.js\r<br/>\r<br/>[OLD LINK]\r<br/>http://www.bitjets.com/parchment.html?story=http://www.bitjets.com/islands.zblorb\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy and please let me know what you think!\r<br/>\r<br/>PS, there is only one way to die, can you find it? \r<br/>\r<br/>Also, make sure you discover the back story as well as solve the puzzles for full enjoyment of the ending.\r<br/>\r<br/>[UPDATE]\r<br/>I have made a hint file. WARNING, THIS WILL RUIN THE FUN OF THE GAME. I would suggest using it only as a last resort.\r<br/>\r<br/>Here is the hint file:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://www.bitjets.com/islands_far_away_hints.htm\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, this game is actually better if you use a stand-alone program instead of the javascript version.  You can save your game progress, it is faster and you get better fonts among other things.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can download the game file here:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://www.bitjets.com/islands.zblorb\r<br/>\r<br/>",
