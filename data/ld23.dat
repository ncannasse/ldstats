I had the time to spend pretty much all weekend on my game, with breaks for sleeping and eating.\r<br/>\r<br/>I had my idea pretty early on, luckily. Unluckily, it was an action adventure game, and every time I've tried to make one of those I didn't finish much of the story. This LD was no exception--the ending is quite abrupt.\r<br/>\r<br/>However, I still think it's possible to enjoy this game, short as it is.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>----Controls----\r<br/>\r<br/>- WASD for movement\r<br/>- Click on dialogue to advance\r<br/>- Click on doors to unlock\r<br/>- Click and hold to shoot once you have the gun\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>----Background----\r<br/>\r<br/>The in-game story may be a bit confusing because of the format I had to relay it in. I also wrote the dialogues all out of order, so they aren't even very well-planned.\r<br/>\r<br/>This tiny world, Drop, is contained within a drop of rain. Its people live in hyperaccelerated time, so much like how each human's life in the universe's lifespan is insignificant, each *'s lifetime is insignificant to the Drop.\r<br/>\r<br/>Recently, Drop has merged with another water droplet, causing a nasty war between their inhabitants. Worse than this is an apocalypse--Drop is falling dangerously close to the ground.\r<br/>\r<br/>It is hopeful legend that a hero will propel Drop back into the Clouds, to allow it to survive for the length of another fall. Guess who that is?\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>----Supported platforms----\r<br/>\r<br/>This section includes some keywords for people who search for their preferred platform to find games to play.\r<br/>Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, or anything else with Flash Player.",

Just dodge them or grab a magic potion which kills every robot in the level.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is graphically and otherwise very tiny, so I recommend that you choose the 'stretched'-option in launch screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game has 16 levels that vary a little. Some are completely based on puzzles while some are based on running from enemies.",

Thanks, Static Void Games, for hosting!  Code was done in Java, graphics in Photoshop.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've added a gameplay details document to try to make the game more playable, less confusing.  This is post-compo.\r<br/>\r<br/>With this game I wanted to experiment with an idea that has been kicking around in my head for a while, temporal portals.  I imagined you having a barrier in your way, but then a portal opens up and your future self emerges, presses a button that clears the barrier, then returns.  You then go through the cleared barrier, create a portal and go back in time to clear that barrier for yourself before moving on.\r<br/>\r<br/>It seems to me that you need to be able to create portals  from the future at any time, but with each portal you are also creating a 'promise' that in the future you will enter a portal to the past.  I wanted to add something that would individualize the players, something that could change with them over time. I chose hats because they were easy to implement (the same hat graphic is used for facing left right and down, it almost worked when facing up, but it didn't cover the guy's bald spot.) So, when a player with a hat portals in, you have to fulfill the promise by portaling out a (different) player with a hat. \r<br/>\r<br/>I realized that this might cause paradoxes and introduced code to prevent that, which ultimately made the game very confusing.  I wanted to be able to play back the path of the one character through time, so you watch him go through each portal until he finally finishes the room.  If the 'promises' were not filled, then this sequence could not be constructed.  I considered adding in 'cameos' to fix hat/no hat problems (the player enters a portal, then you see him inside the time portal and finds a hat floating in  the inter-spacetime void, which he takes before returning to the real world) but I thought that putting the responsibility for avoiding paradoxes on the player would make a more interesting game.  That idea clearly needs to be re-examined post-mortem.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please let me know what parts are confusing or what parts you have a good feel for. Thanks for playing!  ",

After all, why play a game with one tiny world when you could play a game with two galaxies-worth of tiny worlds? G to grab/release planets and F to use the jetpack. The jetpack gives fast movement speed but runs out quickly when carrying many planets.\r<br/>\r<br/>I got in about 25 hours on this one, but there are still a few bugs to fix. I had to cut it short for some work on homework, unfortunately, but I'm still happy with the outcome. However, if something inexplicable happens...try releasing and grabbing the planets again, and try not to let planets collide when you aren't holding any of them. There shouldn't be any problems most of the time...\r<br/>\r<br/>Other tips: The range of Chadley's grab is somewhat finicky, so you may have to line up his hands with a planet in order to grab it. Also, releasing a planet/planet group gives it a bit of angular momentum.\r<br/>\r<br/>Coded in Javascript/HTML5, with library code from the Video Game Development Club at the University of Minnesota.

The game is full of minor and moderate bugs, and the game is far too short (7 levels in all). That said, I had a blast participating and it was quite a learning experience.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is based around spitting out one of three colored blobs of which the main character is composed. Your size is dependent on how many blobs you possess, and you'll need to be very small to fit through some of the narrow passageways. In levels with pressure plates, the Exit sign won't light up until all of them have been triggered by one of your spitballs landing on them.",

By placing the mouse cursor at the bottom edge of the screen, you access different buttons, allowing you too customize a bit the look of your world, his name, and the story of his people. \r<br/>\r<br/>You can move with the arrows keys, and talk to them via space. Leaving your world will make you travel through place created by the other players. At first, the game is filled with generic world, but as soon as people will start to play, you will encounter more and more human crafted places. If you feel so, you can reset your game and start a new world by pressing the R key in game, and then by refreshing the page.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also please, be careful on the bio of the characters. I'm absolutly not sure how my system is bug proof, so I should advise you to only use letters. \r<br/>\r<br/>Dang it, i'm exhausted, haven't slept for 4 days, I can't barely type this thing in a proper english. More to come tomorrow... \r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Made with FlashPunk/Punk UI ( with a modified Yellow Afterlife theme )",

With a small window of time to work, you must grow your colony fast and extract as much profit as possible from the dead rock. \r<br/>\r<br/>SimAsteroid is the first production of Capsaicin Games, jointly @tinheadned and @tenpn. It is written in javascript and uses the CraftyJS engine.\r<br/>\r<br/>Compatibility:\r<br/>\r<br/>Works with latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari on Linux and OSX. Also works on iPad. Please report any problems below.\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions:\r<br/>\r<br/>_There is a limited tutorial, so keep an eye on the status bar on the bottom of the page. The status bar will also warn you of any new issues or problems._\r<br/>\r<br/>You manage your asteroid by constructing buildings and moving colonists between those buildings. Every game turn, each building consumes some resources, and then produces some. If it can't consume all necessary resources, the building does not produce anything. \r<br/>\r<br/>You have 600 days to produce rare earth minerals, and ship them through a freight depot for points. After that you will be out of range of the support ships, and must abandon asteroid.\r<br/>\r<br/>The root of the resources tree are the ores you extract from the asteroid tiles. Each tile produces one type of resource. You can click the Resources button on the right to see the resources around your landing ship, or use the astoanalyser to further explore the asteroid.\r<br/>\r<br/>A mine will extract the ore from the tile, but then it needs refining in another building before becoming really useful. Ice needs melting in an ice melter, iron converts to steel in a steel refinery, regolith becomes plastic when put through a regoplasticiser, and rare earth ore smelts into rare earth minerals.\r<br/>\r<br/>Each building needs energy, which must be produced by solar panels. At the end of every turn, energy not used gets thrown away. The Energy Production label tells you how much excess you are wasting at the moment.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can get more colonists by providing enough excess food and water. Food is provided by providing water to a hydroponics building. If you are running out of room for colonists, you will need to build a habitat to house the new arrivals.\r<br/>\r<br/>**If you're struggling with the size of the UI and graphics, zooming in Chrome (and then possibly refreshing) will make everything larger, and still play fine.**\r<br/>\r<br/>",

To do so, simply take over every planet in each level.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Listed in game via tutorial.\r<br/>Move around by clicking on the minimap or by using the WASD/arrow keys. The minimap shows planets and your current viewport only. This is an RTS so you must watch your resources carefully while fending off the AI or attacking a planet it controls. Build oil rigs to get money, and build turrets or HP regeneration stations as defensive buildings. The only moving unit is the fighter.\r<br/>\r<br/>Click and drag to select fighters, right click a planet to make them travel there. They will attack enemies automatically and attempt to take over neutral or enemy planets.\r<br/>\r<br/>In total there are 9 levels. The AI may either crush you or you it. In general, the AI is most often conservative in the beginning and when it builds up a fleet will send them out.\r<br/>\r<br/>Cheats:\r<br/>Numpad +/- to switch levels.\r<br/>\r<br/>Created with the help of the following tools:\r<br/>GameMaker:HTML5\r<br/>GIMP\r<br/>Audacity\r<br/>BFXR\r<br/>LMMS\r<br/>\r<br/>THERE IS A WEB VERSION OF THIS GAME, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:\r<br/>REALLY IMPORTANT: The tutorial under the &quot;How&quot; button does not correctly draw the first screen of the tutorial. When you press that button and get sent to a blank blue screen, PRESS THE SPACEBAR to continue. The missing screen basically summarizes the information given in these notes.\r<br/>\r<br/>Chrome has a bug that prevents the game from running normally, it wants to run twice as fast as I designed the game to run. I was kind of able to hack around this limitation, but the result was making Chrome run even slower and more choppy than other browsers.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game is HTML5/Javascript. It supports both WebGL and canvas for maximum performance and compatibility. HTML5 is a new technology and there are many differences between browsers (for instance, how shapes and sprites look).\r<br/>\r<br/>This game can get quite intensive and may run poorly on slower machines. If you have any problems with the web version, PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE WINDOWS VERSION.\r<br/>\r<br/>4/24 - Added timelapse. May be 360p for a while.",

So firstly: Thank you for playing my game! I know I submitted this rather early, but it's all because I MEANT to enter the Compo, then decided that I would rather enter the Jam due to a multitude of reasons:\r<br/>\r<br/>1: SDL Mixer decided it didn't want to work, so no sound could be used.\r<br/>2: I just didn't put as much effort as I would have if LD23 took place during Summer. So I'll put a good run in for LD24!\r<br/>3: Motivation and ideas were lacking around the midway point\r<br/>\r<br/>I had fun, of course! I wouldn't have finished at all had I not.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, this is another game that'll hopefully add up to that goal of 1000! We can do it, guys!\r<br/>\r<br/>For those interested in the source: My header file setup is weird, I know, but SDL wasn't looking to cooperate for whatever reason, so that's how it turned out.\r<br/>\r<br/>DESCRIPTION:\r<br/>\r<br/>Blue's World is the interactive story of Blue, a lone blue square, in a room that was completely blue.

Ants will explore the surroundings of the anthills leaving a trail of pheromones when they find something useful.\r<br/>To win you need to capture all the anthills, this is accomplished by having your ants visiting other anthills.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's developed in C++/OpenGL and available for Linux and Windows (Mac if you know how to compile it...).",

It's nothing serious though. You can fix it.

It should take maybe 25 minutes to beat it. If you're stuck, here's some tips:\r<br/> * You start the game able to double jump (jump in the air), and you can upgrade it later.\r<br/> * At the beginning, collect money to advance the game. When you reach $250, you get the ability to grow. After that, keep growing to advance the game.\r<br/> * Grow will only work if you have 90/100 health or higher.\r<br/> * You have to be standing at the base of a structure to upgrade it.\r<br/> * The final boss has a pretty small hit box, right in the middle of its dome. Attack from above and try to hit it right in the center. Launchers upgraded about 6 times are excellent for getting up there.",

			"htmlDesc": "Tiny war is one of those games where you send ships to fight over planets, except the planets actually behave like planets and orbit. The game's tactics thus depend on waiting for a good launch window, as ships that go farther are weaker. There were a few things planned that didn't get in, like some pretty planet graphics and a mechanic involving affecting planetary orbits, but I'm just happy to have actually finished a game this time.\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions:\r<br/>Welcome to Tiny War. You play as green. The goal of the game is to send ships out and destroy blue. To attack a planet, drag from a planet you have ships on to a planet you want to send them to. This will send some ships from each planet you dragged over to the one you ended on. A fleet of ships loses strength the longer it's in space, so try to time your movement to take advantages of differing orbits. Your ships and your enemy's ships will destroy each other if they are on the same planet. The number of ships on a planet is indicated by the numbers above and below it. When your ships are the only ones on the planet, they will begin to capture it at a rate proportional to their number. Once a planet is captured, it will have a white ring when selected, and will begin producing ships. Bigger planets take longer to capture but produce ships faster. Press space to give up the level, and 'd' to turn on demo mode. Try to beat the AI and win the game!",

			"htmlDesc": "&quot;Worlds in Cards&quot; (name picked up at the last minute) is based on the idea that whole worlds, albeit very tiny, are contained inside cards.  The player can be inside a single world at the time, but she can jump from world to world if they are adjacent *and* the landscape matches.  If for example, a world has a ladder going down, then the world at bottom must have a ladder going up if the player wants to move from one to the other (and viceversa)\r<br/>\r<br/>However, you can't control the player directly.  Instead the player's character goes back and forth between the limits of the world--either a single card or a combination or cards correctly arranged that forms a &quot;bigger&quot; world--she is confined in.  Howerver, the player can swap two cards on the screen that have neither an object nor a character, be it the player's character or any other of the characters that are wandering around the level. \r<br/>\r<br/>Even the game's window looks like a card of sorts, althought this is more a side effect of trying to fit the game in my Android phone.  However, I think it fits the theme, specially if you have a large resolution, because the window looks so tiny...\r<br/>\r<br/> \r<br/>I didn't have time to create many levels--5 to be exact--and they aren't very challenging.  I guess it takes much more than I have to make puzzles.\r<br/>\r<br/>I couldn't test extensively the Windows version as I only have a VM and the Linux binaries &quot;work on my system&quot;, but I can't guarante that they will work everywhere (64-bit was build under Gentoo and 32-bit in Debian testing.)   The Android build works at least on my tablet and phone.\r<br/>\r<br/>The music was made with Greasymonkey's autotracker, so I don't claim credit and I don't think it would be fair to rate it.  I tried to use a custom &quot;autotracker&quot; that I did sometime ago, but didn't produce the same kind of quality.  Most sound effects were made with sfxr, except for the sound that the cards do when are swapped; this one was made with a broom.\r<br/>\r<br/>I tried, and failed miserably, to have a look-and-feel reminiscent of GB, partly because I thought that maybe my lack of artistic skills wouldn't be that noticeable.  Oh, boy... how wrong I was!",

This is how I wish it had looked when I submitted it!\r<br/>\r<br/>v2: Based on feedback, I've increased the ambient light from the player's cube, brightened the light burst, increased the duration of the light burst (increased the AI range for the baddies as well to counteract the light bonuses), and changed the light burst key to 'Z', which seems to be more common/acceptable as an action key.  Obviously, all of this has been done to the post-compo build, and the compo version is still what I had at the end of the 48hrs.  Enjoy!\r<br/>\r<br/>I would like to develop the game further.  Any suggestions (whether or not you vote) would be appreciated!  So far, I'm looking at tweaking the lighting, so that you don't have to spam the ctrl key.

			"htmlDesc": "&quot;Free Donutia&quot; is an action/rts game where you have to lead an army of very tiny soldier against the invasion of the evil race of the Tiny Aliens. Of course, they're tiny as well.\r<br/>\r<br/>Save the donut-shaped planet Donutia by taking back all of the five cities scattered on the very limited planet's surface in large-scale (even though still tiny) battles. Lead your tiny men to victory!\r<br/>\r<br/>I had SO much fun making this game, and I'm quite happy with the result! Hope you have fun playing it :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately I haven't been able to test the web version on many configurations / OS's, but thanks to the wonderful people on the irc channel i got some great feedback. Even though Chrome seems to be the best choice for running the game, it should work on other browsers as well. If the applet doesn't load, you can download the runnable jar for your OS and hopefully you'll be good to go :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Here's the link to the time-lapse of my LD weekend:\r<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB06ndhPjyo",

Today almost everything is produced via nano-technologies and the only science that still refuses to accept them is medicine.\r<br/>Or, it has been so far. It's rumoured, that few young talented scientists test a nanobot based cure on people.\r<br/>You are the program, that controls the nanobots. Fight with viruses and bacteries that come across you and save the body. But be careful. If you want to win, you mustn't kill your host although you have to kill some of his cells to spread.\r<br/>\r<br/>In game, you have three resources (Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen) that you can gather through rebuilding cells to nanofactories. To do this, you must firstly prepare them to this with Engineer nanobot. Then you have to rebuilt nucleus of the cell to factory or to barracks with your Builder nanobot. Each enables you to get different troops.\r<br/>You can also just destroy the cell with Gatherer nanobot in order to get much more resources, but for the price of losing the cell. Finally, with your Warbots, you can fight against all sorts of disease. Your Builder nanobot can also build turrets from cells to increase your tactical advantage.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Use mouse to explore the map.\r<br/>Left click selects a unit and gives orders, right click sends them to location.\r<br/>Building: Select a builder, on the bottom of the screen controls show up, choose one and click it, click a cell.\r<br/>\r<br/>For bottom buttons you can use hotkeys: a,s,d,f\r<br/>\r<br/>Nanobots:\r<br/> - Engineer (nanobot with drill)\r<br/>It prepares nucleus of a cell for nanotechnology.\r<br/> - Builder (nanobot with 2 antennas)\r<br/>It transforms nucleus of a cell to buildings such as HQ or barracks. \r<br/> - Warbot\r<br/>Nanobot with powerful shields predestined to fight with diseases\r<br/> - Gatherer\r<br/>It has ability to gather resources from cells.\r<br/>\r<br/>Buildings:\r<br/> - HQ\r<br/>Every nanobot unit except the Warbot can be constructed here.\r<br/> - Barracks\r<br/>Warbot's construction site.\r<br/> - Turret\r<br/>Strong, defensive unit\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Everything else is up to you.",

There are still plenty of not-so-lovely (but not game breaking) collision bugs in this version.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you wish to play the original (with only the 1st crash fixed) select the Original-Web link.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Fixed game-breaking bugs since release:\r<br/>1. When near an item, the collision detection could sometimes fill the player's available item slots with 1 circuit element type, causing the player to no longer be able to progress through the level.\r<br/>2. The collision detection could mess up causing the player to fall off the map and the game to crash.",

Their attacks are coordinated, and surprisingly effective -- the ancient gods are not usually this coordinated in their efforts.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Something is directing them.  Will you survive long enough to uncover the truth?\r<br/>\r<br/>Tiny Gods is my interpretation of the Tiny World theme for LD48.  Tiny Gods is  a 2D &quot;Bullet Hell&quot; game in the style of 1995-1998 SNES games.  In Tiny Gods, you are a new demi-god, but your powers are not yet stable and are easily influenced by your followers on all the worlds you find throughout the universe.  As a demi-god you can absorb worlds to give you ammunition to defeat your foes, or you can stay close to worlds that give you power.  You must constantly balance staying in the proximity of worlds (to absorb their influence) and consuming worlds (to give you ammunition).  But don't stay too close for too long -- the attacks of your foes will damage the worlds as well, changing them into Dead Worlds where the people follow the gods of the underworld -- Pluto and Proserpine.",

			"htmlDesc": "::Goal::\r<br/>You select things, and attempt to guide them to their corresponding things. The small, moving things are selectable, and should be guided to their corresponding large stationary thing. Colors code where they go, as well as their shape (the ones with holes go to the ones with holes, etc.). The faster you get them there, the more points, but any thing that leaves the world, or hits a non-corresponding large thing is lost.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are two game modes:\r<br/>-Time attack mode, where you must collect as many points as possible in 2 minutes, disregarding lost things entirely\r<br/>-Score attack mode, where you die when you've lost 200 things.\r<br/>\r<br/>[NEW]\r<br/>It seems the gameplay here is quite confusing, as even my brother upon vocal explanation and demonstration took two rounds to get it, so instead, I'll now go into excruciating detail. You're adviced to keep an eye on the screenshot as you read along.\r<br/>In the middle of the screenshot there are two large circles (purble and red) that are filled. We call these two for &quot;Nodes&quot;. The four large circles with dark spots \r<br/>(toruses) in the corners we call &quot;Warps&quot;. All of these spawn, at fixed intervals, the smaller versions of each other we call &quot;Particles&quot;. Nodes spawn paricles that correspond to warps, meaning they look the same, in the same color as the warp they correspond to. Warps spawn particles corresponding to either nodes or other waprs. Thus, something coming out of the center circles corresponds to one of the corners, but something coming out of the conrner may correspond to other corners as well as center circles.\r<br/>You are in charge of uniting corresponding particles and nodes _and_ corresponding particles and warps. Any particle that appears it is your mission to get to the corresponsing Node or Warp. Keeping on top of that task is the game...\r<br/>\r<br/>You do this task by &quot;boxing&quot; a set og particles (with LMB) and then routing them somewhere (with RMB). This alone will only get you so far though, as there are tricks to be employed. Once you have given a particle the order to go to it's corresponding node / warp it will speed up.\r<br/>\r<br/>The rest of this section will describe one such trick:\r<br/>The speed-up, coupled with the (Shift + RMB) &quot;append command&quot; functionality ( by holding down shift, and giving a series of points to visit, the particles will visit them in order all the way to the last one) allows you to group units together, string them around the world and towards one node/warp, at which point some of them will speed up, and the rest can be taken off crash course in time.\r<br/>[END NEW]\r<br/>\r<br/>::Controls::\r<br/>-Left mouse button : Selects things by DRAGGING THE SELECTION BOX OVER THEM, clicking will not work!\r<br/>-Right mouse buttons : Gives move-commands\r<br/>-Shift : Modifies the above as such:\r<br/>    LMB now extends the old selection with the new one\r<br/>    RMB adds that move-command after the last previous one given to that unit (used to create zig-zag routes)\r<br/>-Crtl + [0-9], Ctrl + [Num 0-9] / Ctrl + F1-F10 : Creates control group with selected things\r<br/>-0-9, Num 0-9, F1-F10 : Selects the corresponding control group\r<br/>-Space or P : Pauses/Unpauses the game\r<br/>-Escape : Closes the game from the menu, returns to manu from ingame\r<br/>The following two are bugged, and should NOT be used (or be nescessary):\r<br/>-Mouse Wheel : Zoom\r<br/>-Mouse Wheel pressed + drag : Moves view\r<br/>\r<br/>Also important:\r<br/>Once a thing has been routed to it's correct destination, it will become slightly darker and speed up. This is so things don't get cluttered; you can still give it new orders.\r<br/>\r<br/>::Story::\r<br/>Alas, the (back)story fits neatly to an RTS game, not so much to this. But how is it related to &quot;Tiny world&quot; then, you say? Well, the universe is vast, size is perspective, and we only see a few objects somewhere in space, with nothing to relate their size to. For now, let's just assume they are tiny ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>::Comment::\r<br/>See next post...\r<br/>\r<br/>::PS::\r<br/>There was a massive bug in the first version, but this has now been fixed.\r<br/>\r<br/>::Linux Notes::\r<br/>See readme included in tarball.

Stats are recorded and saved, so you can continue playing later on if you get tired for the time being.\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls are shown as you play the first few levels, but whatever:\r<br/>You use the arrow keys, D, and... If it so be, ESC. :(\r<br/>You can also press F4 to toggle Fullscreen, and F9 saves a screenshot in the location of the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Source file is a .gm81 file.\r<br/>I ended up using Game Maker, SFXR, Pxtone (for one sound), Autotracker-bu for music, MS Paint and Paint.net for Graphics. Funfact: I made the font used in this game (with http://fontstruct.com/) over a year ago with the initial &quot;Finding Yourself&quot; idea in mind. The font can be downloaded here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6478756/Misc/shake.ttf\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy, and tell me where I went wrong!\r<br/>\r<br/>~Maple",

(But I have begun to add SFX to the post-jam version.)\r<br/>\r<br/>Update:\r<br/>If you're interested in seeing what I do with this, follow my devlog (muniverse-game.tumblr.com) or @louroboros on twitter. Cheers!\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>The biggest problem was that I didn't have the time to do any real playtesting, so there will definitely be bugs and balance problems, heh.\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, enough excuses. Let me explain the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>(mu)niverse is a very simplified version of a space exploration/trade/action game. It feels a bit like Elite but with top-down 2D of Star Control II, if you're familiar with either of those games. You select a star system, then a planet/moon, and there you can gather resources, visit space stations, pick up passengers, trade goods, and encounter simple enemies.\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions:\r<br/>Star Map:\r<br/>- Arrow Keys move cursor to select star system, highlighted with green circle.\r<br/>- Large turquoise circle is the range of your FTL fuel.\r<br/>- 'Z' selects star system\r<br/>- 'C' returns to Flight Mode\r<br/>\r<br/>Planet Map:\r<br/>- Arrow Keys move cursor to select a planet you wish to visit.\r<br/>- 'Z' travels to that planet (instantaneously) and puts you in Flight Mode\r<br/>- 'C' returns to Star Map\r<br/>\r<br/>Flight Mode:\r<br/>- Arrow Keys -- control is much like classic Asteroids.\r<br/>  * Down is afterburner (&quot;brake&quot;).\r<br/>- 'Z' fire cannon.\r<br/>- &quot;Park&quot; over a space station for a few seconds to enter the Station Screen\r<br/>- Blinking pixels on and around planets are resources -- fly into them to collect them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Station Screen:\r<br/>- 'C' to exit the Station.\r<br/>- Up/Down to select different items on current screen.\r<br/>- Left/Right change screen (Cargo[trade], Missions, Hangar)\r<br/>  * Cargo\r<br/>    - 'Z' - Buy selected good\r<br/>    - 'X' - Sell selected good\r<br/>  * Missions\r<br/>    - 'Z' - Accept/Abandon selected mission\r<br/>  * Hangar\r<br/>    - 'Z' - Purchase selected upgrade\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>Some stuff that I want to be able to happen in the final version:\r<br/>- More visual variety of planets, stations, enemies, etc.\r<br/>- More than Taxi missions.\r<br/>  * Research missions -- acquire and return goods from a remote planet.\r<br/>  * Transporting unruly prisoners...\r<br/>  * Bounty hunting.\r<br/>- FTFTL (faster than FTL) jumping to different sectors of the Galaxy (Galaxy Screen and Jump-gates).\r<br/>- Building a reputation against the police. :)\r<br/>- Hiring crewmembers\r<br/>  * Mechanic - Automatically repairs your ship mid-flight if you have scrap metal.\r<br/>  * Smuggler - Reduces your chance of being caught with fugitive passengers or illegal goods.\r<br/>  * Muscle - Keeps unruly passengers in order.\r<br/>- Jettisoning anything and everything, including passengers and bombs...\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Full disclosure: yes, I have fixed a handful of bugs -- mostly crash-bugs -- post-jam. Anything major added feature-wise will be on the &quot;Post-Jam Online&quot; version. I intend to continue working on this game so let me know if you have any ideas!",

Dig twice in the same place to make a big enough hole for water to flow in it - connect the holes/ditches with water and water will flow in the ditches!\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Walk around with WASD.\r<br/>Interact with objects and NPCs using &quot;1&quot;.\r<br/>Dig wholes in the ground using &quot;2&quot;.\r<br/>When you have completed the first quest you can use the axe with &quot;3&quot;.\r<br/>\r<br/>First press the action you want to use, then press one of the available tiles to use it at that tile. Axe has no animation when facing south.\r<br/>\r<br/>Tip:\r<br/>You can teleport to NPC and to water by pressing T.

He is going with his family to visit a building and he gets scared before going in, which results in being left behind. He then tries to catch up by going up the floors on his own.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The hitboxes didn't end up so good but we didn't have time to try and make them better. Also the panic bar times needed tweaking but we think the idea comes across.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Be patient with the loading, we didn't manage to get the pre-load working, it's just a few seconds.\r<br/>\r<br/>*if you get stuck press R to restart level\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you like it :)",

			"htmlDesc": " So this was my second attempt at Ludum Dare, once again using Construct 2.  It's possible I was a little over-ambitious this time.  But given everything, I'm very pleased with my results.  This is an HTML 5 game, and you need webGl to be able to play it.  I apologize if you're not webGl enabled :(  This can be a bit of a beast even on webGl accelerated machines.  My hope after this Ludum Dare is to learn a lot more about streamlining for framerate and performance.\r<br/>\r<br/>  In Slime Buster Micro, you play as John Pompadour.  You must rid the world of slime.  Shrunken down to their size, you must use your flamethrower, waterblaster, and vacuum to defeat the slimes, collect their droppings, and upgrade your equipment and skills.  In the end you'll face the ultimate...King Slime!!! Good Luck!\r<br/>\r<br/>  WASD to move, W/Space to jump, Mouse to aim, LMB to fire, Q/E to scroll weapons, 1,2,3 to select weapon directly, F/RMB to open Pause Menu.\r<br/>\r<br/>  *If there's lag when leaving the story screen, it's because I ran out of time before I could add a loading animation... the game should load shortly.  Apologies for framerate issues, I'm not sure if we're allowed to tweak for performance after the submission deadline or not.  WebGL is required to play.*",

I used the jQuery library, and GIMP for creating sprites and backgrounds. The 'plop' was recorded using my mouth, and a Zoom H2 recorder. I tried to add some music and more sound (using a beautiful Gretsch guitar), but I wasn't able to finish this in time.\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit 2012.04.27: I added a Start/Restart button and (very) simple instructions. I hope this kind of change is accepted after the 48 hours. I promise I did not change anything except that.

In this game, you must venture from your comfortable home underground into the realms of men, in order to find delicacies to your queen.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your final goal is to enter the very lair of Men, avoid his monstrous guardians, and acquire the ultimate prize for your queen. Can you do it?\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>***\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my second dare. My initial idea was based on the movie &quot;The Secret World of Arrietty&quot;, where a family of tiny people lived hidden in a house, taking food from the house while avoiding the &quot;big people&quot;. \r<br/>\r<br/>The original plan was to have other aspects to the game such as expand your own underground realm with specialists to help you, dealing with humans who would try to close the ant holes, etc. But due to my terrible time management, I only got so far as the &quot;keep the queen alive, and go for the prize&quot; part.\r<br/>\r<br/>At least, compared to my previous LD entry, this was a big improvement. Mobs, Music, Real time, pausing, this game has many technical options not present on Maze Explorer, even if it might look a little less polished. More info about that on my upcoming post-mortem.\r<br/>\r<br/>",

The other game I'm working on has been taking sooo long it felt really good to get in and write a little dirty code over the weekend.\r<br/>\r<br/>All in all I spent &lt; 20 hours on the whole thing. I would have submitted to the Compo but I work at a bar to help make ends meet right now and this weekend I happened to be scheduled for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Friday was the only night I wasn't on till close (2am). I also had not used some of the code in my framework before so I had no idea how much patching it might take to get it up and running, of those 20 hours about 5 was spent on rewriting classes. So, for me, this was quite an accomplishment.\r<br/>\r<br/>I am very seriously thinking about making this into a full game, I like the boulder dropping mechanic and have a ton of ideas on how to make this interesting for 20+ levels.\r<br/>\r<br/>As always feedback is appreciated, good or bad. It actually just puts a spring in my step knowing people are playing something I created. \r<br/>\r<br/>Cheers and happy gaming!",

Code-wise it worked great, I got all the engine coding beginning to finish done within about 8-10 hours. Unfortunately you can't do a major amount of planning art and design-wise, and the final level design took the brunt of the lack of time. It was initially going to be 9 levels (ended up 5) with a much more gradual curve. The game is also quite difficult which I wound have evened out a bit more if there had been more time. And hey, brutal platformers are all the rage these days.\r<br/>\r<br/>All in all though I'm happy with the results, the controls are nice and fluid, the engine does what it's supposed to (although there are some bugs and jankiness) and I survived my first Ludum Dare.",

The game was made in roughly 20 hours of work.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Whats it all about?\r<br/>--- You control a surrealistic character which resides inside a blood cell\r<br/>--- Within each blood cell of our body, there is a tiny litte world\r<br/>--- These worlds vary in size (different levels)\r<br/>--- Blood cells real function is to deliver oxygen around the body. So..\r<br/>--- The character in the game's function is to gather the oxygen bubbles within a blood cell, so that the blood cell can successfully do its job.\r<br/>\r<br/>- How do i play?!\r<br/>--- Use the arrow buttons to navigate. While next to a wall, press left/right to jump off the wall. Hold the arrow down key to slide fast down the walls!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The game was obviously rushed, thus some introductional features didnt make it in. Additional levels, mechanics, polish and some time pressure was planned but didnt make it in. The music and the menu were created within the last hour, which is fairly reflected in the demo!\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used: Aviary for music, Photoshop for art, and the Construct 2 engine for everything else.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you enjoy it!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>- Read more here:\r<br/>--- http://sidetrackgames.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/ludum-dare-23-participation/\r<br/>\r<br/>- See my post-mortem post here:\r<br/>--- http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/04/24/lost-oxide-post-mortem/\r<br/>\r<br/>- Try the tool i used to make my entry for free here:\r<br/>--- http://www.scirra.com/?a=1k2",

Your milage may vary - let me know if it works for you!\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>Development details:\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my third Ludum Dare, and the first one I have finished. I wanted to use a C++ based game engine, as I am doing a technical job interview in the next few days where C++ is a assessed, and I haven't done any C++ in several years :)\r<br/>\r<br/>So, that said, I used the Angel game prototyping engine (built for game jams like this). See (http://code.google.com/p/angel-engine/) I've never used it before, but it seems fairly well rounded. The docs are a little out of date though, so digging through source code was necessary. I built the game in 40hrs, finishing with 4hrs to spare.\r<br/>\r<br/>GIMP was used for graphics, Xcode for programming (Angel engine needs XCode to build on Mac). I used SFXR for sound effects and the music was taken straight from the Angel engine demos.\r<br/>\r<br/>I wanted to add more functionality: Rain that hurts ants, the ability to travel down the anthill and dig underground, random insect encounters and magnifying-glasses of death, more terrain types (rocks, grass etc) and also more AI functionality (ants will help other ants / communicate where food deposits are). All of these features got cut due to time :)\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm super stoked to have actually finished this to a point where it works and is fun - a bit of a personal milestone for me :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Things I learned:\r<br/> * I HATE XCODE! SOOOO MUCH HATE!!! There were many occasions where a physical bug in Xcode itself would prevent me from being able to build my game. I would have to delete entire methods and re-type them before Xcode would link them correctly.\r<br/> * Next time, I'll be using a JS-based html5 engine, so it's much easier for people to play and vote :)\r<br/> * If your game engine supports a scripting language, such as Lua, use it. It will save you a lot of time.\r<br/>\r<br/>",

I am pretty pleased with it, there are some things that could be added or improved but time was running out. I already used a lot of my time for the graphics alone.\r<br/>\r<br/>! Please extract all the files and folders from the zip archive before playing\r<br/>otherwise sounds may not play &amp; custom options might not load from the ini file!\r<br/>\r<br/>There's also different difficulty modes defined in the settings.ini file, but they are untested, they should work fine. Basically they give you more/less lives and change the power of your attacks to make the game more challenging or easy as pie.",

You control a microorganism, and you can swim around the dish eating bacteria, gathering symbiotes, battling your competitor microbes, and dividing yourself to produce more of your species.\r<br/>\r<br/>There are ten levels.  Your goal is to reach the target population level of cells.  You may also be required to eliminate your competitors in later levels.  If you take too long, your petri dish will dry out, and you'll have to try the level again.\r<br/>\r<br/>This was my first entry for Ludum Dare - just heard about it earlier this year.  A lot of fun.  Many thanks to my mom for putting up with my programming.\r<br/>\r<br/>I used the excellent CraftyJS library as a basis, BFXR and GoldWave for sound, Gimp and Irfanview for art, PowerPoint for some other art, and NotePad++ for coding.",

There are bugs, I didnt get to make the level that it was named after, but I'm still proud of it. \r<br/>\r<br/>My theme interpretation was that a tiny world is a small world, and it's a small world after all. So the four levels are themed after Disney attractions, and the fifth level would've been the Tower of the Four Winds (tower in front of the small world ride.)\r<br/>\r<br/>Also my computer does not have an older version of Java, nor will Firefox allow me to download it, so for now atleast the game is a standalone application.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls: w,a,s,d to move.

If the current order is BFDEAC (as in the screenshot), it becomes BFDAEC (A and E are swap). After the swap, if position 1 matches the goal (it does not since F isn't B), your opponent discards a card (if it doesn't match as in this case, there is no second effect).\r<br/>\r<br/>Generally:\r<br/>The card\r<br/>\r<br/>a-b x1:effect1 x2:effect2 x3:effect3 ...\r<br/>\r<br/>swaps positions a and b. After the swap, if position x1 matches the goal, it triggers effect1. After the swap, if position x2 matches the goal, it triggers effect2. And so on.\r<br/>\r<br/>END OF UPDATE 1",

Each level is randomly generated and will never be the same - even if you just restart your level ('R') it will be different. \r<br/>\r<br/>The levels consist of different layers you can move through, but it starts with just one.\r<br/>\r<br/>You always start left, your goal is to get to the right side.\r<br/>\r<br/>The menu works like a console, and from there you can play custom levels (each level is generated from a text - for custom levels you need to write the level into a txt-File - help: Type in 'HELP').\r<br/>\r<br/>It is inspired by Portal, maybe a little bit Minecraft and not much Mario. \r<br/>\r<br/>If you like to comment or criticize - always appreciated.\r<br/>\r<br/>For this game I used my own XNA-Front-End (it was a mess to write all these models in .xml-Files, sorry, but there is not much animation).\r<br/>\r<br/>Because of the use of XNA it should run on every Windows, but you can try to use Linux/Mac with Mono too (never tested, on your own risk).\r<br/>\r<br/>I have made all the textures, models, sounds, songs and texts on my own in the last 48 hours.\r<br/>\r<br/> - YSelf Tool\r<br/>\r<br/>P.S:\r<br/>The tools I used are:\r<br/> Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express (code, build and models)\r<br/> Paint.net 3.3 (graphics/textures)\r<br/> Microsoft Paint (visualising ideas)\r<br/> Microsoft Editor (for planning)\r<br/> Subversion 1.7.3 (version control system)\r<br/> Minecraft Note Block Studio (for the music)\r<br/> sfxr (sounds)\r<br/> Microsoft Snipping Tool (screenshots)\r<br/>\r<br/>P.P.S:\r<br/>The help does not say that, but you can type in &quot;CREDITS&quot; too ;)",

Such as, sun radius shrinking, planet and people preferences so only certain people can be moved to certain planets, static planets and orbiting planets to force the player to time their movements. Just to name a few.\r<br/>\r<br/>We felt this game was screaming to be on a touch screen. The controls would be so much more intuitive on an iPad. Also the action nature of the game is accustom to the app store.\r<br/>\r<br/>We might revisit this idea as there are so many more places it can go. \r<br/>\r<br/>Let us know what you think!

If you make a connection from one end of the level to another in a straight horizontal or vertical line, and step out of the way, the line of tiles will collapse, making the universe smaller, and tiles you stepped on will lose their charge. If you make a connection that doesn't reach all the way across, the tiles will be cleared between the two points, but the tiles you stepped on retain their charge. Confusing at the moment, I know, but try to enjoy the idea and the art, if nothing else :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Synopsis: What if you were a agorophobic nanobot stuck inside an experimental, infinitely repeating universe created by a mad scientist playing God?  Find out in Agorobophobia!  24(ish) (un)playable levels - unlimited possibilities!\r<br/>\r<br/>In this puzzle game, the aim is to reach the end point of each level by destroying cells by placing a start and end point in the level.  Placing the end points at opposite sides of the grid cause the world to shrink!  Level 5 onwards are infinitely repeating, and can also be shrunk until you occupy the only grid space!  Is this world tiny, or infinitely huge?  We'll let you decide.\r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately we didn't get as far as we'd have liked to with this game concept, but nonetheless, we have a playable proof of concept demo that we think is actually a very interesting idea.  If you are interested in innovative ideas, and not too fussed about gameplay, this is the game for you!  (We've included a &quot;skip level&quot; button for good measure ;D )\r<br/>\r<br/>Check back soon for a more finished product!",

I found the result quite interesting.\r<br/>\r<br/>On a technical side it was all written from scratch on just Javascript and Chrome. I'm rather proud of the little debugging interface and quick turn around on playing around on the systems.

Not making excuses! Happy with what I did. This is my first competition, and if it weren't for the fact that I had to go to work I would have done a LOT more.

This is very useful if you get yourself stuck. If you press space, you can shoot yourself.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you are DESPRATE, please watch the low quality walkthrough. http://youtu.be/eKgmgoJYUKA If you like the game so much, you want to make a better walkthrough, or a speed run, message me and I'll put it in this description.\r<br/>\r<br/>All content was created within the 48 hours. Please read the help, its really short, and will tell you the controls. It is your job to figure out how to solve the puzzles. If how the theme fits in is unclear, the whole game is played on a 20x15 tile area. That's a really small world. If you can't get past the second level, here's a hint: you can wrap around the world. Some of the levels at the end are very hard, but they're all possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>To play, download the zip file, extract everything, to a folder if you want, then run extract_then_run.bat. If that doesn't work, you can do into the dist folder and run TinyBoxes.exe.\r<br/>\r<br/>32-bit isn't working right now, I'm working on it ASAP. Please come back to it later, you can bookmark it if you want. There are 3 weeks of judging. If you really want to play it, just install python and pygame in 32 bit, and run the tinyboxes.py, just like a Mac. -EDIT- 32 bit is being a real bugger. I'm very sorry. If you are reading the comments  and want to play it, an install of python and pygame is required. They're not bad things to have though. Just use the same instructions as for a Mac and it should work. Let me know if you try this and it doesn't.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you have a mac, you can download the Windows distribution, and install python and pygame. Then, in the dist folder, run tinyboxes.py\r<br/>\r<br/>http://python.org/download/\r<br/>http://pygame.org/download.shtml\r<br/>--Make sure you use a version with the same bit, 32 or 64.--\r<br/>\r<br/>I FORGOT TO PUT THIS IN THE HELP MENU: R to reset the current level.",

It is your duty to annihilate them for some reason.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is a game for the Commodore 64 made using the Shoot 'em up Construction Kit. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Ludum Dare I decided to go back to my roots and make a game for my first computer :).\r<br/>\r<br/>It's not very finished and therefore not very good even for a SEUCK game, but here it is anyway. I hope you manage to derive some fun from it.\r<br/>\r<br/>The disk image contains both the game executable (&quot;Atomsmash&quot;), and the SEUCK data files (&quot;Atomsmash Data&quot;). You can load it on a C64 emulator or on a real C64, like I did :).\r<br/>\r<br/>Emulator instructions:\r<br/>\r<br/>1. Download CCS64 from http://www.ccs64.com/\r<br/>2. Run the emulator and drag the disk image into the emulator window.\r<br/>3. The disk boots and loads. The screen will flash different colours until this is done. This takes a minute or so since it's emulating the original floppy drive from 1982 :).\r<br/>4. While the game is loading you can configure an emulated input device. To do this:\r<br/>5. Press F10 and navigate to Options &gt; Input\r<br/>6. Configure an emulated joystick on either control port one or two, it doesn't matter which (or you can configure both and play two-player).\r<br/>7. Press escape until you get back to the game/loading screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>I did want to provide an easy way to play online without an emulator but I haven't had a chance to do this due to illness. Sorry :(.",

By pressing space you release eggs from the bird.\r<br/>\r<br/>2. These eggs are blue,green,brown and gold and will produce water,grass,dirt and humans.\r<br/>\r<br/>3. You can then further drop eggs on these to create new stuff, such as a tent is created by dropping grass on a human.\r<br/>\r<br/>4. A tent can then be used to score by raising it up via dropping grass on it.\r<br/>\r<br/>5. Evil ghosts will kill the humans and the tent, but can be disposed with eggs.\r<br/>\r<br/>6. The game can end in 2 ways: you can run out of eggs or one of the ground blocks touches the bird.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is no game over screen, so whatever score you have when the bird dies or you run out of eggs is your final score :)\r<br/>\r<br/>The game uses the brilliant html5 engine Impact\r<br/>http://impactjs.com\r<br/>\r<br/>The music and (shockingly beautiful) art were all made by me. The game and story are loosely based on finnish folklore creation myth and Kalevala.\r<br/>\r<br/>Despite some bugs I am very happy with what I got together.\r<br/>I hope you enjoy the game.",

If you are going to play this version please read the following:\r<br/>We are aware that the game difficulty is not well adjusted, so at the moment it may be a bit challenging to get out of the initial room, and then too easy to complete the rest of the game.\r<br/>Hint: there's a hammer under the couch!\r<br/>\r<br/>The SECOND VERSION (Polished) is the tweaked version we promised. This improved version has now more easter eggs (have you tried to sing, switch the lights off or do funny stuff with the objects?), smoother difficulty, comprehensive help on how to play the game, an incorporated hint system in case you get stuck (just type 'hint') and no bugs that we could find.\r<br/>If you find any problem with the polished version, please tell us, so that at the end of the judging we have a problem-free version.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please vote and have fun!\r<br/>\r<br/>If you are still stuck, check the walkthroughs at our youtube channel.

Along his journey Cary goes through many different environments and encounters many different obstacles.  You play as Cary in this pixelated adventure, there are some cool cats as you go along, so be sure to talk to them especially if you believe you are stuck.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game was developed by The Gaming Project which consists of four members, we worked as much as we could over the three days, but school and work took up some of our precious work time.\r<br/>\r<br/>The games Protagonist Cary and his love Kitie are based on two of our friends in real life who are about to get married, we made this game as a birthday present to the real Cary.  All eight cats (and the one dog) are also all based on pets of our friends.  It was an extremely fun project and we hope everyone who plays it enjoys it.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game was coded in HTML5 which is new for us so not everything is as smooth as it could be.  We plan over the next few days to polish up the game and extend it some more.  In addition we plan to make the sound work on all browsers, currently it does not work on Safari or Internet Explorer.  Below a link to the background music is provided if you are interested.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please let us know what you think and enjoy.\r<br/>\r<br/>***Yes the game is very small, you can zoom in with your browser if it helps.***",

You may choose to reverse the effect by punishing (to counter good) or blessing (countering bad) the structure. Blessings will give you a short-term boost in wisdom income, but a long-term *loss* in wisdom income (translated as &quot;people are inspired by their god's actions, but grow quick to expect it all too often&quot;). Punish should not be used (it destroys output both during and after because of feature-creep in dev time).\r<br/>\r<br/>Upgrading: you can only upgrade one building in a category at any one time, but several categories may be upgraded simultaneously. For example, you may not upgrade two schools, but you may upgrade a castle and a school. All remaining buildings in the same category are upgraded (the new knowledge spreads) once the first completes. ** Upgrade speed is determined by the building's wisdom output. **\r<br/>\r<br/>New buildings are created as existing buildings of the same category reach a certain stage of maturity (hidden value). This process is automatic.\r<br/>\r<br/>Technical note: if I recall (it's 3.30 in the morning, bear with me), you need at least Flash 10.2 to run the game - I don't think I bumped it to 11.2 just because I &quot;could&quot;.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hotfix version uploaded and github pushed (so you can verify the minimal change yourself if desired).

We're pretty proud of this....\r<br/>\r<br/>Idea was djdduty's, but he didn't participate.\r<br/>Me and razorquick expanded upon it.\r<br/>\r<br/>You need at least Java 6 to run this. Get it here www.java.com\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions:\r<br/>WASD to move\r<br/>Hover over planets to popup info window.\r<br/>Expand the drop downs to interact.\r<br/>\r<br/>Ship info:\r<br/>- To Fix: metal = level x 20, oil = level x 10, slaves = level x 5\r<br/>- To Upgrade: metal = level x 50, oil = level x 20, slaves = level x 10\r<br/>\r<br/>Home Planet info:\r<br/>- To Upgrade: wood = level x 100, stone = level x 70, slaves = level x 50\r<br/>\r<br/>Description:\r<br/>You're a dejected robot on your tiny home planet, all alone with no resources. One day a random spaceship crashes into your planet, which you proceed to claim as your own!\r<br/>You start adventuring around your &quot;cluster&quot; of planets (50 of them), quietly stealing resources necessary to upgrade your spaceship and your home planet.\r<br/>Your goal is to conquer the universe, by destroying all 50 planets, making you the most powerful robot ever....all alone.....Forever Alone......\r<br/>\r<br/>How To Play:\r<br/>- To take an action on a planet, you hover your ship over it where a window will popup on the lower right hand corner of the screen. Expand the tab to take actions!\r<br/>- You can only manage to quietly steal from a planet once, all further attempts will cause them to notice you and hurt you by 10 HP. You do still manage to steal, but not as much as the first time.\r<br/>- Attacking a planet will make you take all their resources (to the max your spaceship can hold), and even the population become slaves. However, your HP will go down by the planet's Defense value.\r<br/>- Your home planet is where you store your resources. Storing puts all your resources on the planet. Equipping equips your ship up to the max it can hold.\r<br/>- There is no point to upgrade your home planet, that was for a proposed idea where planets attack your home to try and stop your unending rampage!\r<br/>- Your ship's max HP and max resource capacity can be increased by upgrading your ship.\r<br/>\r<br/>The background music is Clair de Lune by Debussy. I would have performed it (I'm a professional pianist), but I had no time and ended up using an online source. I don't believe you can copyright such music, so it's considered public domain.\r<br/>\r<br/>It has quite a bit of data to load, so give it a minute...I should have put a loading screen :P\r<br/>\r<br/>Coded by me from scratch using my lovely game library: java-game-utils.googlecode.com\r<br/>\r<br/>Art is by razorquick. He's pretty awesome. :P",

The code's still in the game, but it had to be chucked because it laginized the game too much. Also, if you look at the source code, it's a total pile of rubbish because I was in a mega rush.

Though you have to be careful, if you push him too much you'll kill  your hero!\r<br/>\r<br/>Have a quick read through the instructions but most of it should be self-explanatory. The game can be beat! You might have to try a few different strategies though.\r<br/>\r<br/>The download is an executable JAR. In Windows just double click the file. On Mac/Linux should be able to run it with: &quot;java -jar MyLittleDungeon.jar&quot;. Make sure you have JAVA installed! Any problems let us know. And yes, you have to restart the app if you die.

			"htmlDesc": "Hi everyone, and Happy Anniversary to the event organisers! :)\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my third Ludum Dare event and the first game I have ever developed in Unity. Trying to work to the 48 hour time limit with unfamiliar tools meant I really had to cut some corners but I'm fairly happy with the result given the circumstance.\r<br/>\r<br/>With 'Tiny World' as the theme I took my inspiration from Super Mario Galaxy because it seemed an interesting challenge to recreate the very small planets of those games with their 'gravity could act in any direction' physics  ... the first day and a half was spent just trying to get the player model to point 'up', and fall 'down' without vearing off course while turning or walking over such unpredictable and often upside-down terrain; hence the title &quot;Quaternion Nightmare&quot;. All other aspects of the game were developed on Sunday afternoon.\r<br/>\r<br/>If I had had more time I would have added: engaging combat, simple 'key + lock box' style puzzles a boss fight and more than one world as well as music and a menu system.\r<br/>\r<br/>The tools I used in development were:\r<br/>Unity (http://unity3d.com/)\r<br/>Blender (http://www.blender.org/)\r<br/>BFXR (http://www.bfxr.net/)\r<br/>Paint.NET (http://www.getpaint.net/)\r<br/>Spacescape (http://alexcpeterson.com/spacescape)\r<br/>\r<br/>For anyone interested in the physics behind this type of game the following article explains it very nicely: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131997/games_demystified_super_mario_.php\r<br/>\r<br/>Good luck everyone with your own entries!\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy :)",

The only solar system to be found so far that is capable of this is a system of tiny planets, around a tiny sun with tiny inhabitants!

The game is called Shrink Force and you enlarge shrunken, floating, rocket propelled life rafts people created before their tiny demise. You must get to the giant grow ray on the moon to destroy the expanding shrink force and save the universe.\r<br/>\r<br/>CONTROLS:\r<br/>\r<br/>- WASD to move\r<br/>- Space bar to jump\r<br/>- Left click to shoot grow-ray\r<br/>\r<br/>I'll improve this post and post the source when I get home. It was written in C++ using a game engine I wrote myself that uses Irrlicht, Bullet, and irrKlang. It's based off of Unity.",

Also, annoy your good too much and your people will die.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is text-based, and the way you learn what you can do is through the help command, and if you want to learn what you can do for a specific action, you use the &quot;action&quot; help command (so for instance, train help will tell you what you can train)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>This is done in XNA and thus it only works on windows (sorry for all the other OS users, I simply do not know any other language than C#)\r<br/>This requires both the .net framework 4.0, found here:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851\r<br/>\r<br/>and the XNA redistribuable, found here:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20914\r<br/>\r<br/>updated: changed the link to the patched version I had made during the extended submit period, also explains a bit more how to play",

			"htmlDesc": "NOTE: I was right about it working on Mac. I just had no way to test it. xD\r<br/>\r<br/>Premise-\r<br/>An Idea is a world in and of itself. It's afloat in the universe, caught on a breeze, growing large only to be destroyed (Except in certain circumstances). It inspires souls to its side and often conflicts with others.\r<br/>\r<br/>The conflict between the ideas is meant to bring home the 'Tiny World' view point of ideas. While at war, more 'Military' type units were meant to spawn (Unimplemented), enough so that the other three unit types would almost be choked out.\r<br/>\r<br/>While it would take a lot of balancing, the game favors the player when you have a smaller map. The closer to 37 tiles (Half that's displayed) the higher your chance to spawn a unit each turn. Further, the intent was that when you're not at war with another Idea, you can 'destroy' portions of the world, and if you split the map, the parts not linked to you disappear, reducing the map size.\r<br/>\r<br/>Success-\r<br/>Limited. While I got much of what I had wanted to get through done, I didn't complete enough to actually call what I created a game. While you can -do- things in it, it's missing a bunch of functions that would make it -playable-.\r<br/>\r<br/>HUD From top-\r<br/>Left 1: Number- Your total belief, spent to do things.\r<br/>Left 2: Y-&gt;T looking thing- Toggles and allows you to randomly place a tile on that spot.\r<br/>Left 3: * Looking thing- Toggles and allows you to destroy an uninhabited tile, due to the lack of a path-finder, this can break movement.\r<br/>Left 4: Obelisk with waves- Attempts to convert all 'neutral (Yellow)' things on the map (20 Belief for each yellow, with 4x your spawn chance for each).\r<br/>Left 5: Dead Tree- Opens up a refinements/tech menu (Obelisk lets you get belief faster, Heart heals your units/structures more per turn, Sword increases unit damage, Wispy flame increases pop cap) each costs 200 Belief.\r<br/>Left 6: ?- Toggles and was meant to provide info about all of the other parts of the HUD.\r<br/>Left 7: Hourglass- End your turn.\r<br/>Top 1: Population Current/Max\r<br/>Top 2: Spawn chance\r<br/>Top 3: Number of Blank (Little fire) souls. Can become any other type of soul.\r<br/>Top 4: Number of Artistic (Candle) souls. Passively increases Belief, Healing and Damage.\r<br/>Top 5: Number of Creative (Compass) souls. Can work in a structure and increase its output by 50%.\r<br/>Top 6: Number of Convincing (Sword) souls. Moves to the closest non-friendly structure and attempts to destroy it.\r<br/>Top 7: Number of Obstinate (Shield) souls. Attacks any non-friendly Soul on a tile you own.\r<br/>\r<br/>Clicking a tile, when not changing/destroying, pops up a blank window which was meant to display information about a structure (In use, training, health, owner). I just didn't have to time to implement it.",

We'd really like to complete it.\r<br/>\r<br/>This was our first jam, and the first time we've attempted to make a full game together. The main focus of the project was to learn how to make games in HTML5 and to get experience in pixel asset creation. Though the game wasn't finished, we learned a heck of a lot and had loads of fun.\r<br/>\r<br/>The idea was to present a world in which the only currency is &quot;progress&quot; (the stuff that fills bars). To the inhabitants of this world, achieving progress is all that matters in life.\r<br/>\r<br/>It was intended to be a satire on the current state of 'achievement'-based game design - especially within MMOs - where some players can be compelled to feel that their game world is more important than the real one, when in fact, it is 'tiny' in comparison.\r<br/>\r<br/>In its current state, it's a simple demonstration of basic platform mechanics and tile rendering in HTML5. In the future, there will be an ultra-compelling level-up mechanic, NPCs to talk to, and hopefully an ending of sorts.\r<br/>\r<br/>One of the biggest lessons learned during the Jam was that no matter how small you think your idea is - it's still pretty big.",

(I'll get his last name right once I've slept) to put together a game that evokes the feel of a musical within a 72 hour timespan.\r<br/>\r<br/>Specifically, we felt that it wasn't enough to directly involve lyrics in the gameplay: we wanted to tell the kind of stories that are told in musicals, with the same sort of tunes.\r<br/>\r<br/>While a little rough around the edges (the time constraints were a big factor in this) we actually did it! We really didn't get a huge amount of chances to playtest this thing, so we'd love any and all feedback you can send our way. We're both really excited to look into doing more projects like this, so any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated.\r<br/>\r<br/>More info on how we put this all together will be coming by once sleep has been had.\r<br/>\r<br/>Note that the post-comp version only added a small explanation on controls.",

He even stayed awake for more than three days between work and us just to help us.\r<br/>Unfortunately, Zapa disappeared on Sunday\r<br/>I really wanted to finsh a game though so I gave up on C++ and coded the entire game from scratch in Java.\r<br/>Here is our finished product.\r<br/>\r<br/>Our thanks go to Zapa for being awesome.\r<br/>\r<br/>Make sure you have the newest Java Runtime Environment installed.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you have any questions or concerns email me @ staydynamic@gmail.com\r<br/>\r<br/>PS: Collect the propane tanks to get more propane.",

(and vice versa).\r<br/>\r<br/>- viruses : All the opposite of the previous one : they undo all defenders do.\r<br/>\t\t\tThe more you have of them on a zone, the faster it will be to get a new component, but the faster it'll alarm the computer.\r<br/>\t\t\t\r<br/>\t\t\r<br/>Actions:\r<br/>- attack : only enabled if you have viruses on the selected component. X viruses will &quot;kill&quot; x defenders of the attacked component.\r<br/>\r<br/>- move : only enabled if you have code movers on this component. Move the selected unit to the selected component.\r<br/>\r<br/>- build : only enabled if you have code builder on this component. Allows you to build a new unit.\r<br/>\r<br/>- realloc : reallocate the memory of the selected unit. Actually, it's a big word to say that the unit is destroyed.\r<br/>\r<br/>Interface:\r<br/>no keys.\r<br/>\r<br/>click on the components : \r<br/> - left : select the component. allows you to perform actions from this component\r<br/> - right: show additional informations on the component.\r<br/>\r<br/>click on the buttons :\r<br/> - attack : you need to left click a component to attack it:\r<br/> - move : you need to select a unit in the displayed menu, and then a component en which send it.\r<br/> - build : you need to select a type of unit to build\r<br/> - realloc : you need to select a unit to delete\r<br/> - end of turn : end your turn, apply all you actions, and let the computer play\r<br/> - cancel last : cancels the last action;",

			"htmlDesc": "EDIT:\r<br/>Finally, after (as you may have guessed) 8 nights and 9 days of work, I hereby introduce you to the new version of &quot;Attack On Planet XXS-01&quot;\r<br/>\r<br/>The basic mechanics are in place: you control the turret with the mouse, right button shoots, left button places a satellite. The movement is somewhat smoother than before.\r<br/>If you press the Space key, an orbit will be drawn on screen. If you then place a satellite (while pressing the Space key), it will follow said orbit, instead of being stationary.\r<br/>\r<br/>There's a new HUD (there's &quot;A&quot; HUD, in fact XD). It shows:\r<br/>  - Score\r<br/>  - Energy\r<br/>  - Highscore\r<br/>  - Active weapon  (bottom left of the screen)\r<br/>  - Active satellite (bottom right of the screen)\r<br/>\r<br/>To change the type of satellite to use, just press the 'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R' keys. The satellites are:\r<br/>- Type 1: shoots like a Boss\r<br/>- Type 2: tractor beam. Kinda weak, though - it only slows down the enemies\r<br/>- Type 3: repulse beam. Move them out of the way!\r<br/>- Type 4: energy sucker. Steal their energy to increase the turret's regeneration rate\r<br/>Placing a satellite sucks half of the available energy (50 units). And they regenerate their energy too, now.\r<br/>You can place up to 4 satellites on screen simultaneously. The only requirement is to have enough energy for its &quot;teleportation&quot;\r<br/>\r<br/>Two new types of enemies, that you will encounter from the 8th wave onwards:\r<br/>- Mine: slow and erratic movement, but smallish (hard to hit) and with quite a bang!\r<br/>- Mecha: enters an orbit around the planet and chases the player's position. It has a front shield that repels energy shots. And that's as much as I can tell :D\r<br/>\r<br/>The 'Ripple' gun (number 3) is weaker than before, but it has the ability to slightly push enemies back (depending on a variable 'weight' associated with each enemy type)\r<br/>\r<br/>There are some new graphical bells and whistles, of course. Like a nifty tiny life bar that shows you how your enemies are feeling.\r<br/>Oh! And there are some sounds! No music yet, though...\r<br/>The game can be completed successfully. But it won't be easy. Trust me on that one XD\r<br/>\r<br/>Please try this version out if you feel like the original Ludum Dare version had some potential. You'll see you were completely wrong! XD But, should you vote, please vote solely based on the original version!\r<br/>\r<br/>ORIGINAL POST:\r<br/>Please enjoy my first Ludum Dare game to date! :D\r<br/>\r<br/>Source code included with the .exe\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy, and thanks for your time!",

Blue really hates Red.\r<br/>\r<br/>BTML (Buggy, Tank, Missile Launcher) is a RTS game that takes place on a small, round planet. You expand your base by adding modules and floors to your flat. This allows you to construct units. You attack and defend by placing units on one of the 3 lanes. The enemy has learned this as well, so watch out, you might meet him on the battlefield!\r<br/>\r<br/>Warning: The game is quite hard :).\r<br/>\r<br/>Hint1: Build a factory to build units\r<br/>Hint2: You can add floors to your building by pressing the + button at the top of your screen. MORE MODULES :)!\r<br/>Hint3: Long range units can shoot past your short range units.\r<br/>Hint4: Use upgrades!\r<br/>Hint5: Don't give up, it is beatable! Make the blues proud!\r<br/>\r<br/>Creators\r<br/>Cavit &amp; Vic\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools used:\r<br/>Wasabi Chips\r<br/>\r<br/>Update: Bug Fixed where labels did not show up, be careful boys and girls, GL calls are a tricky thing in Unity :).",

And I must say it was one heck of an experience! \r<br/>\r<br/>So without further ado. Here's our entry: Cube God!\r<br/>\r<br/>You are a young and inexperienced god that has to use your elemental powers to construct and sculpt up the land for a race of tiny people called &quot;Tinimen&quot;. but the thing is your powers dont always work &quot;on cue&quot;. So they come to you randomly. And you are forced to just put things in a spot that you feel they will fit. Hence why it it is labeled a puzzle game. But with sim-like gameplay melded into it. \r<br/>\r<br/>Right now we didnt get to get in everything we were hoping to. But for now you can at least get a good idea of where we were going. After the compo. We will push further and get the full game completed. But for now... \r<br/>\r<br/>What is working: earth blocks, water blocks, and fire blocks. earth blocks turn into grass after a while, water dissipates unless completely surounded, and grass is grass. Fire does nothing except for turn all nine touching water blocks to earth\r<br/>\r<br/>WASD and QE control camera\r<br/>\r<br/>space and left click both place a block\r<br/>\r<br/>Credits:\r<br/>Mike Poole- Design &amp; concept\r<br/>Logan Granberry- Programming &amp; 3D\r<br/>Pat Pereria- BGM\r<br/>\r<br/>Thank you and enjoy!\r<br/>",

If you don't know why do you need it, don't build it.\r<br/>\r<br/>And... press &quot;?&quot; often. At least once for each tile.

The most unlikely places of all for life.\r<br/>\r<br/>You must now help one of those lifeforms to survive by killing the big bad boss that have emerged from the back, dark side of the robot.\r<br/>\r<br/>But how can you do that? The only things these lifeforms can do is play music and dance to it.\r<br/>\r<br/>Luckily, almost all lifeforms on the robot's body cannot resist the dancing rythms. They are all children of the DiscoDroid...\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>===== CONTROLS =====\r<br/>Use the arrow keys to move.\r<br/>\r<br/>Press and hold &quot;D&quot; to play music. Enemies close to you will dance and follow your moves. Hold down &quot;F&quot; at the same time and your violent enemies can be used to do the fighting for you!\r<br/>\r<br/>Gather enemies to fight the final boss in the fortress!!!\r<br/>\r<br/>===== HELP =====\r<br/>\r<br/>Watch the playthrough video if you can't figure out how to kill the boss (or not able to run the game at all).\r<br/>\r<br/>Good luck!",

Basically, I just wanted to make a game for Ludum Dare, having never done so. Graphics, music and sound are all made by myself in a period of 48 hours. There isn't a whole lot of variety and I didn't really have time to make any battle animations or enemies that did things other than attack, but hopefully the game is a little funny to at least one person and a good waste of 15 minutes or so. \r<br/>\r<br/>THE ENDING!!!\r<br/>\r<br/>Yeah, I know. I didn't have time to do more and the story actually starts getting good here. I might pick the game up again and release WINZIG DX SUPER AWESOME EDITION or something with a complete story, more variety, etc. I left out the fact that you get Eliza in your party and you actually get to a town and meet people instead of just traversing the inside of Jack's cubicle. There's always tomorrow, eh?\r<br/>\r<br/>CREDITS\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks to Dragon Quest for inspiration and RMVXACE for the engine because without it lol what is programming? Next time I hope to make something that's all from scratch though, engine and all.\r<br/>\r<br/>EXTRA TIPS!\r<br/>\r<br/>You can full screen by pressing alt + enter\r<br/>You can run by holding shift\r<br/>If you &quot;Guard&quot; you will regain HP for free\r<br/>You can save anywhere, but the save points are there to regain HP/MP + inspire you to save\r<br/>\r<br/>JUDGES!\r<br/>\r<br/>Made using an engine (RMVX) but everything else is mine.

Dual\r<br/>weapon gameplay, one for killing and another for pushing the walls back.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>How To Play\r<br/>-------------\r<br/>\r<br/>From the title screen press ENTER to begin the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>During the game you control your ship with the arrow keys.\r<br/>\r<br/>As time goes on, enemies will fly at you and the walls will slowly close in.\r<br/>You have two guns to deal with both of these problems:\r<br/>\r<br/>Pressing (or holding) X will shoot the Alpha gun, a blue bolt that will kill\r<br/>enemies. Kill enemies to earn points.\r<br/>\r<br/>Holding C will charge and shoot your Beta gun. A pink bolt that pushes the\r<br/>walls back when it hits an enemy.\r<br/>\r<br/>The bar at the top is your health. It goes down when you take damage. The game\r<br/>is over when your health goes to 0 or the walls crush you\r<br/>\r<br/>Tips\r<br/>------\r<br/>\r<br/>Some enemies have a chance to drop powerups. The red powerup will restore some\r<br/>of your health. The blue powerup will improve both of your guns.\r<br/>\r<br/>Try to get the blue powerups whenever possible, this will improve your Beta gun\r<br/>so you can push the walls back when they start to close in really fast.\r<br/>\r<br/>About\r<br/>-------\r<br/>\r<br/>Made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 23\r<br/>Leaf &quot;leafo&quot; Corcoran 2012 &lt;http://leafo.net&gt;\r<br/>\r<br/>Must be run with Love 0.8.0 if using the `.love` file.\r<br/>\r<br/>Powered by:\r<br/>\r<br/> * &lt;https://love2d.org/&gt;\r<br/> * &lt;http://moonscript.org/&gt;",

Highlights of LD23 included TWO power blackouts (the first was for 7-8 hours).\r<br/>\r<br/>Game Summary:\r<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>You play as an unknown character, whos been rejected by the people he belongs to. You've spent too long, lying on the floor in a dark and abandoned old dungeon, completely forgotten. \r<br/>Suddenly you take it upon yourself to escape, and so that is your main mission - starting by escaping the cell youve been in for an immeasurable amount of time, into an unknown and potentially dangerous environment. \r<br/>Lots of critters scurry about the floor, and with thanks to a special ability (the very ability which got you into so much trouble in the first place) you find you can inhabit the bodies of the smaller creatures scurrying nearby.\r<br/>\r<br/>Maybe this will be your first step towards being free again?\r<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Made with Blender(BGE), Gimp, Audacity and coded in Python.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>&gt;&gt;Read the Readme.txt!&lt;&lt;\r<br/>Controls are in there, I didnt have time to add all of the instructions in-game, but most major controls made it into actual in-game popups.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>**** Missing VCOMP100.dll error????\r<br/>Some people have reported that the game wont run due to a 'missing VCOMP100.dll' error. This is to do with not having installed the Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable on your system\r<br/>Its a pain that this is happening, but quick google search will come up with several different places to download (go for the one hosted on the Microsoft website). Once thats installed everything should go smoothly. (for those of you who are really keen to play this game, but who are being stopped by this error)\r<br/>****\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>-Audio issues fixed in v0.9-\r<br/>\r<br/>Ill be trying to get both a mac and linux version up asap as well, so no one will be forgotten hopefully :)\r<br/>Also, note, you may need a pretty modern rig to run this game. Theres a link below to a less resource intensive build of the game, either way though -let me know if your fps are acceptable - or not. That was my main concern during the development of the game....\r<br/>\r<br/>Full 48 hour timelapse of the creation of the game below!\r<br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-s_raRVcF0\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>So feel free to download (30mb) and give it a shot! Id appreciate feedback and comments.\r<br/>\r<br/>Windows(32bit)- http://www.mediafire.com/?7684syfaa19day2 (as in the header)\r<br/>\r<br/>*source is also available (~85mb) (see header)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Original build (v0.6) is here, this is what I first submitted, and is 64bit windows only, with show stopper bugs - so most people wont be able to play it - http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?ly15m87itpqkoj0\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Is the game running slow for you?? \r<br/>Heres a build which should run faster for those with slower computers/laptops, Ive cut out the dynamic shadows so youll lack some eye candy there. And the frame size is reduced to 800x600. \r<br/>Link -  Win(32bit) http://www.mediafire.com/?c4e3u8oribpz0ba",

It's my first try and I'm happy with myself. \r<br/>\r<br/>The game is a shmup about a tiny spaceship against a big and tough boss with increasing difficulty when boss health is decreasing. \r<br/>\r<br/>Please, read the &quot;Readme&quot; file. There are the controls' guide to play it. Sorry, I didn't have the time to explain it in the game. If you have a doubt or advice, PM to e-mail or tweet me. I will answer your questions.\r<br/>\r<br/>The music is not mine, though. I get them from Newgrounds' webpage and i has give the credits to their respective artists (in the Readme file and in the ending scene), like says the Newgrounds' webpage, so I'm not breaking any rights using it.\r<br/>I put them because no videogame deserve be &quot;in mute&quot; and they gives a better videogame's feeling.\r<br/>\r<br/>But i will try to learn to create music so in the next Ludum Dare i can say &quot;It's all mine&quot; xD\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you enjoy it.\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: I'm posting an updated version of the game with some fixed bugs, some animations added, lower sfk volume and some patterns changed. Maybe it's a little more difficult than before, so enjoy it xD",

He was a happy little dust bunny - it was a warm home, comfortable and cozy.\r<br/>One day he heard a sound... a horrible terrible whirring sound! It made his ears hurt and he could feel the ground shaking as whatever was causing it drew near! \r<br/>A giant machine of some kind was at his door! It was going to eat him! It drew close then stopped suddenly. It's pilot had moved away, leaving the machine running. This was Tiny's chance.\r<br/>He knew that he had to run for it - whatever this sound was didn't make him feel good at all, so he started to hop away...\r<br/>\r<br/>Little did he know where he was heading...\r<br/>\r<br/>Little had he thought the world was outside of Thohkowch...\r<br/>\r<br/>Little hope he had for finding a new home...\r<br/>\r<br/>This little dust bunny would leave home, only to uncover...\r<br/>\r<br/>Tiny's World\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions:\r<br/>\r<br/>You may use the Windows File, or Love2D File.\r<br/>To run the Love2D file you must have Love2D installed ( http://love2d.org )\r<br/>Double-click the LOVE file to run the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your goal is to find a nice cozy home to live in. \r<br/>Make your way through the game by hopping through obstacles.\r<br/>You can jump on enemies, or maybe you could find something better...\r<br/>\r<br/>Keep an eye out for the Kitten!

However, the Gambler was seen placing the bomb at the rally. We believe the Clockmaker does not personally know the Gambler.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is a network of saboteurs disguised among groups of innocent citizens. Bomb instructions were passed between multiple pairs of saboteur acquaintances.\r<br/>\r<br/>Review the security tapes from today to track the note and uncover the saboteurs.\r<br/>---------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>This game is based on the concept of six degrees of separation, also known as a small-world network. I wanted to show how short connections between acquaintances can lead to long chains. Making a large world much smaller.\r<br/>\r<br/>Actually what I really wanted to show was the completely different and totally bitchin concept I worked out for Alchemy. Oh well. Hopefully this hits the Tiny World theme well enough. Enjoy.\r<br/>\r<br/>---------------------------------------\r<br/>UPDATE\r<br/>---------------------------------------\r<br/>The fixed version has the following changes:\r<br/>- Fixes the end-game success/fail check to actually work properly. (Pro-tip: &quot;for each&quot; on a string doesn't iterate through its characters in AS3)\r<br/>- Reduces the swf height a bit to fit better on smaller screens\r<br/>- Fixes a typo: ELMINATED -&gt; ELIMINATED\r<br/>",

Use rocket jumps to reach places that have never been reached before!\r<br/>\r<br/>Also features a menu, with fully customizable keybinds (overloadable to up to 3 keys per action!), the option to invert both mouse axes, volume control, and a FOV slider! It might be tempting to increase the FOV, but this game is played best with the default FOV. Still, if you're beyond pro quake level, set it to 140 for maximum fisheye\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy!

If anyone wants a standalone .exe version to try, you can get it here: http://www.mediafire.com/?t29xvhkehvigngu\r<br/>\r<br/>The likelihood of issues is high, however. This is due to XNA projects being dependent on other libraries that the installer puts in place if they are not already present. Essentially, if the XNA framework libraries are already present and correct, the game should work, if not, you will likely have issues if the game even runs at all.",

			"htmlDesc": "THE SHORT\r<br/>---------\r<br/>Race your unicycle around the little globe as fast as you can! \r<br/>\r<br/>Local multiplayer one-button racer for the web! Everyone can play! Open your browser, grab a key, and hang on tight! Careful, though: build up too much speed and you'll take off, losing traction and slowing you down.\r<br/>\r<br/>* Controls: ANY KEY. LITERALLY ALMOST ANY KEY ON YOUR KEYMABOARD.\r<br/>* Strategy: Hold your key to accelerate, but let off before you fly off the planet and lose speed.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>THE DETAILS\r<br/>-----------\r<br/>I developed this game solo in 72 hours. The game is built on the HTML5 canvas and Javascript. Libraries at work behind the scenes include CraftyJS, Jukebox, Underscore.js, and jQuery. Sound effects were generated by the always-lovely sfxr (flash port at superflashbros.net). The game has been tested in Firefox 11 and Chrome 18 for OSX.\r<br/>\r<br/>I had plans for multiple unicycles, multiple planets, more advanced physics, and a lot more feedback to players. I've had the whole one-button UI flow worked out for a while and this was going to be the proof of concept. As is, I barely squeaked in under the Jam submission deadline (with SECONDS to spare!), so I wasn't able to realize anything more than the basic gameplay.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>KNOWN ISSUES\r<br/>------------\r<br/>The sound isn't great in Chrome. I think Zynga lists this as a known issue with Jukebox on Chrome, something to do with Chrome's audio codecs. Use Firefox if you can.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game swallows most keystrokes, so your browser shortcut keys probably won't work while the game is displayed. This is the price of admission.\r<br/>\r<br/>The player color selection is overly simple and gets confused when multiple players join and leave. There are only 10 colors in this version, so they repeat if you have more than 10 players. Also, the player tint is supposed to apply to the sprite, not the background, but there's a long-standing bug in CraftyJS that I haven't gotten around to patching.\r<br/>\r<br/>You'll find there are some key combinations on your keyboard that work better than others when you have several players. Anyone who played local multiplayer shareware games in the '90s remembers this problem. =) Experiment in the pregame to make sure everyone's key works when all the others are held down. Try hooking up a game controller or wiimote and binding the buttons to keys to cram even more players in!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>LEAVE A MESSAGE\r<br/>---------------\r<br/>Each and every smidge of feedback is fabulous; please do leave a note or hit me up on Twitter (@mildmojo) if you have any words for me. And thanks for giving it a try. Really, thanks.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>",

The hardest part of making this game was the shrinking menu system, it kept on having bugs non stop.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game is kind of split into two parts.\r<br/>1. You have to collect coal and machine parts in order to fly home and win the game.\r<br/>2. If you don't fly home you can shrink the worlds so that they are tiny. You can also change their climate and gravity. and you can plant and harvest plants.\r<br/>\r<br/>Press F1 for more info on the shrinking system and on the game in general.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks goes to:\r<br/>Lumberjack_Liam for Ideas and support.\r<br/>Missjaykay for support and testing.\r<br/>Lava_laura for the hot chocolate.\r<br/>Ysmor the wise for suggestions and testing.\r<br/>Titou for ideas, bug spotting and testing.\r<br/>\r<br/>*Spoiler!: for those of you who want to find all four parts but can't find the last, here are the locations: Second planet in Alpha, Beta, Third planet in Gamma, Last planet in Omega.*",

One day two derpanauts land on your surface their conversation goes as follows.\r<br/>\r<br/>derpanaut 1: We've discovered a new world!\r<br/>derpanaut 1: We could claim it as our own and colonize it.\r<br/>\r<br/>derpanaut 2: We could, but it's such a tiny world(not theme or anything)\r<br/>\r<br/>derpanaut 1: Yea, I guess your right, it is tiny.\r<br/>\r<br/>Rex hearing this becomes fed up with being &quot;tiny&quot;, he decides he will stop at nothing to get revenge on those humans who called him tiny. He starts by eating the derpanauts and their space ship. Then continues to eat planets smaller than him to amass size.

The catch is that these objects are &quot;quantum entangled&quot;, so moving one moves the other!\r<br/>\r<br/>Figure out the rules that govern the world and make your way through 10 levels, starting off very easy and becoming much more challenging. The controls are simple - clicking and dragging.\r<br/>\r<br/>The sound effects were mostly created with processed recordings of my voice.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is a Windows XNA Game. The zip file for Windows assumes you have XNA installed. If not, you can use the link for the ClickOnce installer - that will install the XNA redist along with the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: There are bugs in levels 7-10 that make them easier to solve than I had intended.

			"htmlDesc": "At the dawn of civilization can you master this tiny little paradise?\r<br/>\r<br/>Build your civilization and keep it alive throughout the generations.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Start a family, choose your mates well. Exercise, get plenty of sleep, learn your craft.\r<br/>\r<br/>Some hidden features, some not.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Only 73.1kb!!\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: Clicking on a house / dwelling will PAUSE the game!\r<br/>(it's a long game)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>I was SOOO close to adding a family-tree browser and a time log to make this one really interesting.  Oh well.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Strategy Guide:\r<br/>---------------\r<br/>A few people have asked about strategy, here it is:\r<br/>\r<br/>You start with 3 families, each with a brother and a sister.  They cannot mate with each other.  On the left are females, the right are the males.  PAY ATTENTION TO THE LAST NAMES,  the first one is the mother's last name and the last is the father's last name.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you do not mix genes properly, bad things happen.\r<br/>\r<br/>DO NOT OVERWORK your people.  Their health will decline rapidly when they are tired.  \r<br/>\r<br/>They best way to gain fitness is to chop wood.\r<br/>\r<br/>To chop wood click on a villager, click on a nearby forest then click on the grass where you want him/her to pile the chopped logs.\r<br/>\r<br/>Better fitness = Less health issues with ageing.\r<br/>\r<br/>Build homes for your people so they can rest and breed.  They do not need to enter the house to rest, they just need to be near it (24 pixels).\r<br/>\r<br/>To build a home,  select a person,  click on a pile of chopped wood, then select an empty location.\r<br/>\r<br/>To upgrade/maintain a house,  do the same but select a dwelling already made.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Dwellings will break apart over time so they must be maintained.\r<br/>\r<br/>When a new child is born, ONE parent may leave the house.  If you orphan a child they will die.\r<br/>\r<br/>New children are very weak.  Let them rest a while then send them out to do work.  Keep them near-by homes and neighbours so they don't die of exhaustion.\r<br/>\r<br/>Villagers cannot be mothers or fathers until they are at least 10 years old.  The average life expectancy for perfectly fit people is about 35 years.\r<br/>\r<br/>The optimal strategy is to build three houses and get your original families breeding and -if you are feeling ambitious - inter-breeding as quickly as possible so that you have a larger gene pool to work with in the future.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Make one villager chop wood then rest, chop wood, then rest.  Make another villager pick up wood and build/repair a shelter. This is the most efficient way to build and maintain shelter.  Do this once for each shelter and get the kids helping out too to increase their fitness.\r<br/>\r<br/>When a villager's health begins to decline with age (everyone dies eventually),  let them become parents,  or if they are really fit and good at chopping wood work them to death.\r<br/>\r<br/>P.s. yes the simulation is supposed to be 'slow'.  When you have a huge village trust me,  there is a lot to micro-manage.\r<br/>\r<br/>That's all I can think of.\r<br/>\r<br/>Good luck!",

Look like you were wrong. Welcome in a tiny world, where the sky touch the ground and no one go through it.\r<br/>But it's your lucky day. The local elder tell you about the legendary emergency escape. No one know what it look like, but it should let you teleport somewhere else.\r<br/>\r<br/>Be brave, explore this world, find the exit, and this will end as a story you'll tell to your children.\r<br/>\r<br/>[what was the plan ?]\r<br/>What is a tiny world ? The first thing I've think of is a snow globe. Small also bring to me talk about rogue-like from #ludumdare. \r<br/>So the base was to add mining and crafting to a rogue-like interface. The interface is copied from Crawl Stone Soup, the only rogue-like that I've played. As you will see, mining and crafting haven't made it to the game. Lack of time/motivation.\r<br/>But anyway, you don't make a world by yourself. There was plan for multiplayer. I'll try to polish a bit more this game after the LD.\r<br/>\r<br/>[thank]\r<br/>Thank you for reading, sorry for the lack of fun.\r<br/>Have a nice rating session o/",

(reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptogenesis_(physics) )\r<br/>\r<br/>=== HOW TO PLAY ===\r<br/>\r<br/>You play as the blue leptons and use the left mouse button to select and move the different leptons, use the right button to pan around the level. \r<br/>\r<br/>A lepton (blue) and its anti-lepton (yellowish green) will annihilate on contact (The exception is if the anti-leption is positioned on a spawner (orange square), then the lepton survives)\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal is to annihilate all the anti-leptons while having at least one remaining lepton yourself! If there are any anti-leptons remaining without you having any of the normal lepton (for example if there are an antitau left, but you have no tau particles) the game is lost.\r<br/>\r<br/>=== COMMENTS ===\r<br/>\r<br/>There are only two levels, but they might give you the general idea of what this game is capable of!\r<br/>\r<br/>Code, music and graphics by Karl Bristav",

Ease-ification will occur post-compo.\r<br/>\r<br/>Update #2: I've found a few bugs in the jumping code and have fixed them. V 0.3 is much more consistent with jumping AND you can jump onto adjacent ledges from a standstill. Also added inventory boxes.",

Your creations (written in a tiny Scheme-like language) will battle for supremacy of the tiny world of the computer. Its a small and simple world, but the nature of the language makes it an extremely open one. \r<br/>\r<br/>Contains a complete custom tank-controlling progamming language, graphics and some buttons. And a disabled slider bar. Read the README for documentation and instructions.\r<br/>\r<br/>Stuff I was happy with\r<br/>----------------------\r<br/>- I like the concept. It's not that original, but programming little tanks in Scheme-like is actually quite fun (for me).\r<br/>- The language implementation is pretty solid. I spent way too much time on it, but it's not that horrible.\r<br/>  \r<br/>Stuff I would have done with more time\r<br/>--------------------------------------\r<br/>- A better code editor. I recommend editing the code in a better editor and using cut and paste. Also syntax highlighting would be awesome.\r<br/>- More game mechanics and balance. It's very minimal as it stands.\r<br/>- Sound and Music.\r<br/>- Much better language documentation. I had a tutorial planned, but ran out of time.\r<br/>- Better looking UI.\r<br/>- Testing on Windows and Mac.\r<br/>\r<br/>",

You are the god in control of a tiny world, but there are other, bigger, gods out there who do not look kindly on your rise to power.\r<br/>\r<br/>You have no direct control over your units, only the mix and number of each that exist. It is up to you to make sure there is an adequate food supply, and a sufficient number of them to hold off invaders.\r<br/>\r<br/>I didn't have time to complete the additional levels I had planned, but I plan to complete more sometime this week and put it up separately. This first level is an introduction to your main units and how they interact and building story, the second level would be taking them to the world of another god and using them to invade.\r<br/>\r<br/>P.S. There are hints that show up as you play at the bottom of the screen, they are relevant to what is happening at the time.\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE: I added a WIP link with the latest version, with bug fixes and new features. Including a 4th unit that plants grass.\r<br/>\r<br/>FAQ:\r<br/>\r<br/>Q: Why did I win?\r<br/>A: In the instructions (button on the title screen) it says that you need to hit 2500 Life force to beat the level. I'll try to make that clearer in an updated version.\r<br/>\r<br/>Q: How do the zombie waves work?\r<br/>A: The number of zombies is random, currently its (5 + random(1-6)) * wavenumber. I'll try to make it more incremental.\r<br/>\r<br/>Q: Why did some of the humans run from the zombies?\r<br/>A: The women (humans with bows) run from zombies but are required for men to reproduce. Men will run towards zombies and fight them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Q: What is the relationship between Life Force and Life Power? \r<br/>A: Creating Life builds your Life Force. The more complicated the life is the more Life Force it is worth. In order to hit 2500 Life Force and end the game you will need a lot of Men. In order to sustain a lot of Men you will need a lot of Cows to feed them. Life Power is granted to you every 4 seconds based on the amount of living beings that currently exist in your world. It caps at 200 and is the currency used to create life.\r<br/>\r<br/>Q: I plateaued at X life, how do I get more?\r<br/>A: Build more units! The more units you build the higher your life force! Just keep building till you hit 2500.\r<br/>\r<br/>",

If anyone can tell me how it would be greatly appreciated. I know it's a bit early but I feel that if I start to add other stuff, it will loose that sense of completeness that I think it has now.  I'm happy with it and I like the little &quot;gimmick&quot; it has.  Arrow keys to move, and you can double jump.  A quick tip is that this game is majorly about saving your second jump for the right time.  Hope you guys like it and good luck everyone.  This game is quite hard, sorry but I didn't want to ruin it by making it too easy, and I used to making hard games.",

When you click &quot;Lock In&quot;, the game of survival begins. \r<br/>\r<br/>Balance is key: too many hares on a tile and they will reduce the rate at which edible plants grow. Too many foxes on a tile and they'll hunt the hares to extinction. No hares for the foxes and they'll starve. \r<br/>\r<br/>When the simulation is complete, you will receive points for each surviving animal: 5 points for a fox and 1 for a hare. The highest score on each puzzle is recorded. There are 12 puzzles for you to try.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you enjoy playing!  =)\r<br/>\r<br/>- Truce\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>TL;DR - Drag land tiles and animal tokens to complete the map, click Lock In. Watch it go, then reset and try for more points.",

The aim is to create worms with specific patterns by feeding them the right coloured food in the right order.  They have a habit of turning at the wrong time though or eating the wrong coloured food.\r<br/>\r<br/> Instructions\r<br/>\r<br/>-Left click drops food.\r<br/>-The colour of the next piece of food in shown in the bottom right hand corner.\r<br/>-When a worm eats a piece of food that colour is added to the front of their body.\r<br/>-The worm you are trying to match the colours of is in the bottom left hand corner.\r<br/>-Your score is shown on the left and the time remaining on the right\r<br/>-Matching a worm gives you points and more time\r<br/>-When the timer reaches zero its game over.\r<br/>\r<br/> Hints\r<br/>\r<br/>When worms get older / longer they die and make way for new worms.  Try to feed longer worms to get rid of them quicker to make way for smaller worms.\r<br/>\r<br/>The sequence of colours must be in the correct order from front to back. If you have to create a match to a worm with a red head and blue tail first find a single blue worm.  Then feeding it one piece of red food will create a match.\r<br/>\r<br/>The worms move at different speeds.  Try and find slower worms to feed for matches and try and get rid of fater worms by feeding them up quickly.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE :  \r<br/>\r<br/>It seems my instruction wrinting skills are weak. I knew the game was fiddly to play but I didn't realise the concept was tricky that tricky to grasp. I will try and describe it again now I have had more sleep.   \r<br/>\r<br/>There is a worm shown in a box the bottom left corner. The aim is to feed the worms randomly milling around the screen to that they match the length and colours of the worm in the box.  \r<br/>\r<br/>You can't control worms directly but you can drop food in front of them to feed them. The next colour food in displayed in the bottom right. So if you have to match a worm that has a red head and a blue tail you need to find a worm that is just a single blue dot and feed it some red food. You will then get points and more time for getting a match and another target worm for you to try and match will appear in the bottom left hand corner.  Rinse and repeat.",

Each race comes with a unique magic ability that is only available while they are being played. On turns that you change your race (from the race you used on your previous turn), you will forfeit collecting resources.\r<br/>    Goblins: can deploy magic resources as defensive units.\r<br/>    Beasts: attack with one extra unit per deployment.\r<br/>    Undead: receive a new defensive unit for each slain victim.\r<br/>    Humans: can deploy magic resources as offensive units.\r<br/>    Dwarves: defend with one extra unit per deployment.\r<br/>    Elves: can attack territories that are farther away (neighboring their neighbors).\r<br/>Collecting resources: \r<br/>After choosing a race, you are automatically awarded new resources that correspond to the types of territories that you control. Green grasses yield attacking units, blue waters yield magic units, and red clay yields defensive units.\r<br/>Deploying troops: \r<br/>You can deploy troops as offensive, defensive, and sometimes (depending on your race) as magical. You may deploy as many troops to as many territories as you'd like until you either loose an offensive campaign or click on the TakeTurn/EndTurn button at the bottom of the screen.\r<br/>    Offensive deployments can only be made to uncontested or enemy controlled territories. Uncontested territories are automatically won, and all of the offensive units immediately begin defending that territory. Enemy territories must be won. Each offensive unit is has a 50% chance of defeating a defending unit (even rolls are successful). When you have at least as many successful attackers as there are enemy defenders, you win the battle and any excess attackers begin defending your newly acquired territory. When you lose a battle, you lose your deployed units along with the ability deploy any more troops on this turn.\r<br/>    Magical deployments are only possible with the goblin and human races. Other races' magic abilities are used automatically.\r<br/>    Defensive deployments can only be made to territories that you already control. The number of defenders on a give territory is shown on the top face of the die in that territory. So there is a maximum of 6 defenders per territory.\r<br/>",

There are too many scary people out there who want to hurt them. My condition is not based in any such fears. I simply preferred the indoors, and had no reason to go outdoors. It got to the point that everything I needed was in my home. Some call me a freak. But I don't need to go outside. Perhaps I could if i wanted to, perhaps I'd break down - either way, it doesn't matter. My home is my world. My own, personal, clean, orderly, perfect tiny world.&quot;\r<br/>\r<br/>The first game I have EVER made, completed within 72 hours with a great group of friends, the ENTIRE game was made from scratch, story, php events story system, graphics, music and more! Coded in PHP, CSS and HTML. We hope you enjoy the story of Eve and her tiny world!\r<br/>\r<br/>",

Thanks Adam! http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/04/30/tiny-world-tour-ludum-dare-23/ **\r<br/>\r<br/>My only plan coming into LD23 was to draw a rectangular, pixel-art kiwi (the bird, not the fruit). It really didn't look like a kiwi in the end, but that's okay, because I like it. And hey, I made some kind of a game for it to live in! \r<br/>\r<br/>The game itself is semi-autobiographical, and attempts to equate mental health issues with biblical concepts. It's built in AGS (Adventure Game Studio), as I'm not much of a coder. So it's a very non-traditional point-and-click game - no inventory, and only one puzzle: how to get the hell outta there!\r<br/>\r<br/>** Make sure you use &quot;winsetup.exe&quot; to set it to run in a window, unless you want to be truly frightened! **\r<br/>\r<br/>** If you're interested in what I get up to with my team, head along to http://seethroughstudios.com **",

I first set out to build a roguelike but decided to instead build a dungeon crawler where the world only updates as you move (similar to a roguelike, but not bound to tiles).  This would be friendly to &quot;deciding what to do next&quot; and would allow for a pretty decent mobile experience.\r<br/>\r<br/>I ended up with base systems for all of that, and then only had time to implement one enemy and a couple types of loot before I ran out of time.  I will definitely continue working on this!  In fact I already have it running on my iPhone and iPad and hope to release it before long!\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE: source code released. Has an extra, unused music track (WHICH IS WAY GOOD) and a couple scribbles from my notebook that I made while working on it (THERE IS A DRAWING OF A WALKING BURGER).",

However, diving a bit and then accelerating makes you gain height. This may need some trying but you have infinite retries!!\r<br/>\r<br/>All this is also explained in the in-game instruction screen.

			"htmlDesc": "This is a Java game where you have to prepare a tiny world for people from Earth to be evacuated to. I hope you can figure out how to play, I don't really have time to explain much here...\r<br/>Alright, here's where the original notes section ends and my first bit of free time since the actual competition begins. That's right - I'm going to put instructions in this notes section. Maybe I'll even make an extended version, but don't count on it.\r<br/>\r<br/>When you open the game, you'll see a title screen with some navigation buttons. If you don't know what to do here, you shouldn't be judging video games. Oh! You should probably go into the difficulty levels and choose &quot;Easy&quot;, because &quot;Normal&quot; is really hard and &quot;Hard&quot; is absolutely impossible.\r<br/>When you start the actual game, you'll see an orange planet. Some rabbits will start popping up. I originally intended for these rabbits to have some significance, but all they actually do is get in your way and never die.\r<br/>On either side there's a blue menu bar. At the top of the left one, it lists how much of each resource you have. From top to bottom, these are: money, the dust the planet is made of, metal, stone, glass, wood, and dirt. At the bottom of all these is the CO2 and oxygen percentages in the atmosphere - it should be 50-50 right now, I decided to make it say that when the planet has no atmosphere at all. As I recall, the atmosphere has to be at least two-thirds oxygen for you to be able to win, but you should aim to keep it as high as possible to be safe. I always find this to be very easy, so don't worry about it too much.\r<br/>On the right menu bar, there are a bunch of pictures of buildings. If you hover your mouse over one it will say how much of each resource it will take to make it. If you click it, a picture of that type of building will start following your mouse. Click to build it. (Clicking off the planet will make the building disappear if you want to select something.) You can't build on another building or on rabbits. (Fun fact: making this mechanic took up a great deal of my time, and I only realized later that it was rather useless.) From left to right, top to bottom, these building are:\r<br/>-   House - you need a certain amount to win the game. Make as many as you can and upgrade them fully, because this amount is rather difficult to reach.\r<br/>-   Dust Digger - gives you dust over time, gives you more dust depending on its upgrade level. Dust is the most important resource in the game!\r<br/>-   Glass Factory - Turns dust into glass over time. Glass is required to make and upgrade houses, so these are important. It's also important because it puts CO2 out into the atmosphere, and trees will not grow without CO2. They pollute more and make glass faster when they are upgraded. \r<br/>-   Some Trees - These are probably the most interesting buildings in the game. They are not random, like the other buildings; they steadily grow, converting CO2 into oxygen as they do, until they run out of CO2 or become as tall as possible. Once they become this tall, they will stop growing but continue to convert CO2 to oxygen. Trees cannot be upgraded.\r<br/>-   Sawmill - Cuts down nearby trees for wood. Taller trees yield more wood. Cuts faster when upgraded.\r<br/>-   Composter - Converts wood to dirt. The only use for dirt is, I believe, creating trees. Also, composters cannot be selected. This is a bug.\r<br/>-   Mine - Identical to Dust Digger in everything except appearance and the fact that it produces stone instead of dust.\r<br/>-   Transmuter - Converts dust to metal. Metal is required to build and upgrade many different types of buildings, including houses, so these are very useful. Converts faster when upgraded. Also, at level 1 they do not pollute, but when they are upgraded they do.\r<br/>When a building is clicked on it will be selected. The menu on the left will now say the type of building, the upgrade level it's at, have a picture of the building, a button to upgrade it if it can be upgraded, and a button to sell it. When the upgrade button is hovered over, it will say the cost to upgrade, and when the sell button is hovered over, it will say the value it can be sold for.\r<br/>At the bottom left of the screen there's a timer that says how long you have left to get the right amount of oxygen and to build and upgrade enough houses. If you finish early, you can click the &quot;I'm Done!&quot; button. When either the timer runs out or you click that button, it will tell you whether you won and why. You can keep playing after that. If you ever want to go back to the title screen, though, you can click the &quot;Title Menu&quot; button in the lower-right corner.\r<br/>\r<br/>tl;dr? Go away.",

Anything under 30 is &quot;good&quot; though the game gets harder as time goes on, so in theory a time OVER 60 would be even more difficult to achieve.. let me know.\r<br/>\r<br/>Had no ideas this LD so I wrote a game engine from scratch to pass the time. 3 hours before the end, I came up with a really basic and cruddy idea.. :-) That's why it's so simple.\r<br/>\r<br/>It runs well in Chrome, Firefox, and on IE 9.

			"htmlDesc": "Tips (Read if you're having a difficult time):\r<br/>----------------------------------------------\r<br/>-Potions can be (and always could be) used AT ANY TIME.\r<br/>-Every item increases your fighting (and some fleeing) chance.\r<br/>-In the beginning, your fighting chance will be 15% less than your fleeing chance.\r<br/>-Fortresses and Towers are difficult, so be prepared (with potions) before you go.\r<br/>-Massing potions, and deciding when to fight or flee are very important.\r<br/>-Dying a few times is normal. If you really are completely lost, head for a Fortress to get your first item.\r<br/>\r<br/>Theme Integration:\r<br/>------------------\r<br/>The whole 'Tiny World' theme is part of the fact that the cubic world is tiny, and that its basically on top of a Rubik's cube. This is just what came to mind when I thought of 'Tiny World'.\r<br/>\r<br/>General Notes:\r<br/>--------------\r<br/>Instructions are in-game.\r<br/>No sound. I didn't have enough time to generate and implement it as I actually just finished. :(\r<br/>\r<br/>Development Notes:\r<br/>------------------\r<br/>-I didn't use any libraries really, I just used whatever is offered by HaXe (which is open-source).\r<br/>-I did use some base code, though they were extremely simple . I actually ended up discarding most of them and rewriting them during the compo anyway.\r<br/>-I used someone else's free-to-use font. There are no specifications with personal vs. commercial use, but here is the pool of fonts I got it from, and it's creator's profile: http://www.dafont.com/max.d967\r<br/>\r<br/>Gameplay Notes:\r<br/>---------------\r<br/>-When the map moves, it always moves upward so you know what's next.\r<br/>-More potions = not failing.\r<br/>-Its not a very long game, and figuring out where the items are comes from exploring, really. The village shop will give you some hints after you buy &lt;something&gt; *hint hint*.\r<br/>-It has been confirmed that the game is DIFFICULT, but not impossible! ;) Play the [Updated] version for a (hopefully) easier time.\r<br/>-Be wary that if any bugs exist (I think I managed to pick up most, if not all of them :D), they will exist in both the [Updated] and [Original] version.\r<br/>-I would really appreciate if you played the [Original] Web link first, primarily because that is what I believe I should be judged on. Not much difference exists except what's listed in Post-Compo Notes.\r<br/>\r<br/>Post-Compo Notes:\r<br/>------------\r<br/>-Found out the Windows version is sort of due to some things I hadn't considered with compile targets. Opt to play the Web link rather than download the Windows version, at least for now.\r<br/>-I took the comments below into consideration and made the game somewhat easier (I hope) in the [Updated] version.\r<br/>-I made the text on the signs for OK and Yes/No lighter and easier to see.",

Viruses have infected humans and being the adventurous scientist you are, you devised a way to eradicate them. You built a special submarine, which when shrunken to microscopic size, will be injected into the infected human. You'll maneuver your sub through the blood stream, and fire your specialized laser, which you also created, kill all viruses you come into contact with. You'll need to fly through the whole body to make sure you get them all. \r<br/>\r<br/>Good Luck to all who dare enter this Tiny World!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Arrow Keys to move\r<br/>Space to fire\r<br/>M to mute music \r<br/>U to unmute music\r<br/>\r<br/>Easy Mode - Red Blood Cells will not hurt you. Those are the bright red diamond-looking things.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hard Mode - Red Blood Cells WILL hurt you.\r<br/>\r<br/>Feedback is always welcomed!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Note:I'm no beethoven, so don't expect good music lol. It worked in a pinch though. Recommend muting music. You have been warned *giggle*\r<br/>\r<br/>Note 2: It has come to my attention that there are 2 bugs in my game. The first one is when you die and restart the game your instantly killed. The second one deals with starting the game in hard mode and instantly dying. I have fixed these in my offline version but can't upload it to be judged. So I will tell you work arounds for them. \r<br/>\r<br/>The first one is easy, if you get to the game over screen that tells you that you lost, just close the browser and open it again.\r<br/>\r<br/>For the second one, when you choose 2 for hard mode make sure you press x before any of the bright red blood cells are down near the bottom of the screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>I really can't believe I missed those in my play testing.\r<br/> \r<br/>Note 3: Uploaded a bugfix version. \r<br/>- Fixed Hard Mode Insta-death\r<br/>- Fixed Starting the game again after losing\r<br/>- Added Auto-Fire",

I think it's pretty self-explanatory in-game (there is an included tutorial), but I'll explain here, anyway:\r<br/>\r<br/>You're the president of a galactic harvesting company. You build harvesters on suns to harvest their energy and ship it back to earth and sell it. (Click the green button in the bottom right corner to build a harvester)\r<br/>\r<br/>However, the space commies (you all know the USSR was evicted from earth in '94 after World War III, right?) will do anything to attack your precious, precious energy. They'll send ships to attack your transports. You need to protect them. (Click the purple button in the bottom right corner to build a turret)\r<br/>\r<br/>CANCEL BUILDS BY PRESSING 'ESC'!\r<br/>\r<br/>There was no time to implement an end goal or a title screen, but I think this is an excellent first shot.\r<br/>\r<br/>KNOWN BUGS:\r<br/>\r<br/>- Turrets place farther away from earth than where you put them.\r<br/>- Game is impossible to beat if you follow the tutorial (ships come too early to build a defense turret)\r<br/>- Defense turrets do not aim anywhere.\r<br/>\r<br/>Edit: I forgot to mention that you may cancel the current selection (harvester or turret) by pressing ESC at any time.

			"htmlDesc": "I wanted to play shogi instead of doing the LD so I made an implementation of the minishogi variant of shogi (Japanese chess). :D\r<br/>\r<br/>You can play against the computer, it's not the greatest AI ever but it does a standard minimax and can be challenging. At the highest level, having lots of captured pieces can slow down the AI a lot.\r<br/>\r<br/>Some info about minishogi and shogi on wikipedia:\r<br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minishogi\r<br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi\r<br/>\r<br/>I have not used the Japanese characters to make the game more accessible. Instead I've used diagrams that show how the piece moves. I hope they are understandable.\r<br/>\r<br/>*UPDATE*\r<br/>\r<br/>MINI-HOW TO PLAY:\r<br/>So this is basically a variant of chess. The goal is to capture the opponent's king. You have to actually take the king since I didn't implement checkmate.\r<br/>\r<br/>The pieces are from left to right: King, Gold general, Silver general, Bishop and Rook. On the second row in front of the king there is a Pawn.\r<br/>\r<br/>Rather than use the Japanese characters like normal shogi, I've made diagrams of how each piece moves. Normal line means one step in that direction, an arrow means as many steps as required.\r<br/>\r<br/>Like chess you capture by moving on the square occupied by an opponent's piece. You cannot jump over pieces. Unlike chess the pawn has no special capture move.\r<br/>\r<br/>In shogi, captured pieces can be moved back into play on any empty square. This counts as your turn. The only restriction is that the pawn can't be dropped on the last row (since it couldn't move).\r<br/>\r<br/>Promotion: Most pieces (all except gold general and king) can be promoted if they move to, from or inside the promotion zone. In minishogi the promotion zone is the row furthest away from you (like in chess).\r<br/>\r<br/>Pawn and Silver move like Gold when promoted.\r<br/>Rook and Bishop gain an extra one step move in the directions they don't move normally.\r<br/>\r<br/>Promoting a piece is optional except for the pawn (since it would have no move left if left unpromoted). But most of the time it's a good idea to do it. Pieces always revert to their unpromoted state when captured.\r<br/>\r<br/>For experienced shogi players: I didn't implement special rules to forbid two pawns on the same column and or giving checkmate with a dropped pawn, so you can use those should they happen in a game. They don't really matter for minishogi anyway.\r<br/>\r<br/>That's all ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>BUG FIX: I've made a little bug fix in the submission hour: the AI would sometimes resign suddenly. That was not intended and could confuse and frustrate players trying to learn the game so it will always play a move if possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>I used Unity, coded in C#, made the graphics with Modo, ZBrush, FilterForge and Photoshop, sounds with SFXR and music with Autotracker and Reason.\r<br/>\r<br/>--== Please leave me a comment when you rate, thank you for playing my game ==--\r<br/>",

Things have gone too far, posters alone used to help but now you must use another tool, the brainwashing ray. You must brain wash the citizens to get popularity and make them respect the environment. However the military aren't too happy at you brain washing their loyal citizens and they are out to get you! Every time you use the ray they are alerted to your presence and send a plane to sort you out! With the popularity you earn, you can buy upgrades to your brain washer, as well as buying propaganda items (fliers, blimps, billboards) until eventually everyone is environment-happy you save the world! Left click on the shop items to buy, and left click on the BrainWashingRay(tm) to start brainwashing citizens! The aim of the game is to get your poularity upto 150, if you have any questions or would like to send me your score please do so, my twitter is @EliteWareGames and my email is admin@eliteware.info . I hope you enjoy my game!",

You are the last human alive and your spaceship is being compressed towards a singularity.

You need to collect these cells before the universe shrinks to a tiny point! \r<br/>\r<br/>As the universe contracts, weird quantum effects are being observed on a macro scale such as the superposition of matter.

I spent first 36 hours to implement Virtual Machine with simple TXT and GFX editor (I recorded more than 16GB of screen video during this time). Then I spent remaining 12 hours by creating game itself (inside of the new Virtual Machine). Virtual Machine is called NE-VM1 (NE as 90Edges) and is currently available only for Mac OS X. I will try (on Monday) to convert the game to Windows as soon as possible.\r<br/>When you finish the game the Virtual Machine Editor is unlocked and available to modify the game. ;-)",

You can also use the arrow keys if you like.\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal of this (very simple and slightly buggy) game is to hit as many &quot;dead&quot; wires as possible. In keeping with the theme (Tiny World) I thought up an idea where you're inside this wire and you have to &quot;repair&quot; the little dead areas on the wires inside the larger wire&acirc;&brvbar; if you've ever taken a look inside one of those you'll understand. Not realistic or anything and it's not supposed to be! :D\r<br/>\r<br/>I am SO glad I finished this. I learned so much making this game, even if it is a pretty simple game, and does have a few bugs. (Such as the random generation of the &quot;dead&quot; areas being a bit dodgy from time to time.)\r<br/>\r<br/>I rushed it out to meet the deadline. There were a few things I wanted to add, such as lightning bolts that would kill you, working out the more minor bugs (of course) and adding a boost feature. And more GUI, a better menu, and a little intro animation explaining the point.\r<br/>But oh well, it's still a &quot;complete&quot; game anyways. Perfectly playable and surprisingly&acirc;&brvbar; kind of fun IMO. I didn't expect to impress anyone with this, just learn more myself and be more motivated this time around after giving up during LD22.\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, enjoy. I'm glad I'm finally done so I can start playing all these awesome games I've been seeing people post WIPs of the past two days. This has been a great Ludum Dare for me, and from what I hear from friends and other devs, it was for them too.\r<br/>See ya!",

Great success!   :-)\r<br/>\r<br/>Technical notes:\r<br/> * Tested on Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9, on Linux and Windows XP and 7\r<br/> * It does all the drawing and junk in software, so it actually needs a fairly powerful CPU to run at full speed.

In your way are other NanoBots that have gone rogue due to the defective Chip. You can fight, stun or attempt to flee the squishy MiniBot, the imposing GorillaBot or the all-mighty TankBot. Players can heal their NERD by traveling on the circuit traces in the system. And if I get time, I'm going to add power ups when you visit the capacitors, LEDs and resistor boss fights as well.

But, a lot of the code is setup for my primary idea... which I think is mostly unique.\r<br/>\r<br/>The idea that I wanted to do is that as you kill enemies you level up and gain more bits. You store programs in your memory bank. Some take up a single bit and others more. You have four to start with. I was hopefully going to make these programs item drops from the mobs. In fact the mobs are setup very similarly and have a random set of programs that fit into their memory (which has the same size as yours if you're at the same level). \r<br/>\r<br/>I didn't get to do everything I wanted. Here's the short list:\r<br/>1) enemies need to attack back\r<br/>2) inventory to hold dropped algorithms\r<br/>3) the ability to reflash your memory...\r<br/>\r<br/>The code is fairly close to having everything work together, and I'll probably finish it in the near future.\r<br/>\r<br/>Here is the list of the current programs (many of which are implemented, but you can't change which ones you use).\r<br/>\r<br/>Aesthetic Programs:\r<br/>ChangeShape\r<br/>ChangeColor (Note: the random colors of mobs!

			"htmlDesc": "There are still some bugs in this one, mostly physics related ones. I'm sure there are probably ones I don't even know of, seeing as I am submitting this with... uh, like 5 minutes left.\r<br/>\r<br/>It was kind of rushed, but the core engine is complete- there is one flying enemy, one walking enemy and about 10 level maps. All of these elements undergo randomization that is derived from a seed you enter at the start of the game. Also, it will tell you letters and numbers are allowed in the seed, but only letters are currently. This will be fixed soon of course but it really shouldn't matter anyway.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is completable, although you will certainly notice the dearth of content. I opted to make a single enemy of each variety (walking, flying and boss) and in the end that was all I had time for- even then I had to rush. Alas. I suppose that's what I get for beginning a whole 24 hours late.\r<br/>\r<br/>I got a bunch of help on this from my friends Marius Schneider, Zachery Delafosse, and Benjamin Pullen.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is made in Game Maker, so it's windows only right now.\r<br/>\r<br/>Check out the readme for controls and basic story info! \r<br/>\r<br/>Uses the SGAudio DLL for game maker by snake5: http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=506072\r<br/>\r<br/>**** WHAT IS THE PIONEER? ****\r<br/>\r<br/>It's a game about a supernatural little being who goes between tiny planets in space and exterminates the monsters that inhabit them. My idea with this was that the &quot;tiny world&quot; concept could translate into a lot of small, separate places conveyed in a screen-based platformer.\r<br/>\r<br/>The design for the final version of the game is kind of leaned towards being an almost roguelike sort of escapade- the rooms are not actually randomly generated, but based on set skeletal structures with lots of points of articulation.\r<br/>\r<br/>In every map there are bits of solid and stuff that might not appear, enemy slots that have a higher chance of being filled the further on into the play session the player is, etc. There are also twelve color palettes and four tilesets that skin themselves over the levels.\r<br/>\r<br/>Speaking of the randomized features, they aren't all purely aesthetic- the monsters, in particular, all level up as the player survives longer. These levels give them points that they allocate into statistics and abilities- giving them more survivability through hit points, dole out harder damage to the player, or move faster. The skill builds are not global between all monsters of a single type, but rather become randomized on each level- slimes could be very fast and jump between the floor and ceiling in one stage, and be very slow with a lot of HP on the next.\r<br/>\r<br/>Again I am highly disappointed that I couldn't work fast enough to supply more content than what's available here, but I hope the barren framework and concept is enough to catch your interest to watch its further developments. There are a lot of different enemies planned; teleporting wizards with ranged attacks, skeletons that try to get to you, a wheel-shaped creature with four legs that travels along all sides of solid surfaces, and a lot more. More player abilities are also to come in a more fleshed out release, such as lava resistance, slow-fall and a few other neat things.\r<br/>\r<br/>More features and tons of content are definitely in store for this game, so please keep watching if it has caught your interest!\r<br/>\r<br/>I had a lot of fun working quickly to meet a deadline and I'll definitely want to get a better head-start on the next Ludum Dare!\r<br/>\r<br/>**** UPDATE: POST-JAM VERSION 1 ****\r<br/>\r<br/>This is not a greatly fleshed out version of what was first released, but it does have a few things brushed up: the environment tileset composed of blocks has been redone and looks nicer, levels with unfair jumps were tweaked to be easier and you can now restart the game [bypassing the logo + sound] after you die or win by pressing enter.\r<br/>\r<br/>The end-screen restart was supposed to be in for the initial release, but a small coding error caused it to make the audio DLL freak out and produce a lot of loud, weird glitchy noises... so I, unfortunately, had to temporarily pull it.\r<br/>\r<br/>There's still more to come for this game!",

Cities can also be used as cover for bullets.  Leveling first improves your jump height. When you first start you are only able to jump to the first 3 islands.  This is not a bug, it is by design. The final and third level will give you the ability to fire bullets.\r<br/>\r<br/>The goal of the game is to make the opposing player's lives zero.

But, the game was too ambitious. I couldn't include some of the elementary functionality, like love + breeding. I decided to submit nevertheless. Should have started with gameplay instead of graphics, as always.\r<br/>\r<br/>The graphics are made solely by code. Everything is just arcs, rectangles and lines. I'd really need some tool for that, took a hell lot of time -.-\r<br/>\r<br/>It's really more of an ant farm watching experience. Still, enjoy!",

Use the left mouse button to shoot and throw things.  The red rock (follow the red arrow) is your seed rock.  Throw other rocks at it to create your planet. You can get rocks by destroying meteors (follow the brown arrow).  Be careful not to let any meteors hit your planet when it is small as it will break apart.  Once a planet is finished you can start another one.  A planet is finished by adding five clouds to it.  Clouds are added by finding ice blocks (follow the blue arrows, they are only available once your planet is a certain size) and throwing them at your planet.  Clouds will cause grass to grow which will earn you more points.  The is no end game so the aim is just to get a high score.",

This was in my instructions screen but I seem to of not updated the image in the build I uploaded.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've tested the game in IE9 and Chrome and it runs at a much faster framerate in Chrome fyi. Also it has sound effects (no music sadly) so I recommend headphones if you want a little sound :)",

This also works for things like doors and portals.\r<br/>To combine two items together (be it in the inventory or on screen) use the HAND icon. Just select the first item (in your inventory) and click on the item you want to combine with.\r<br/>To pick up items, use the SATCHEL icon (the one with the hand gripping at a small bag).\r<br/>To examine/look at items, use the EYE icon.\r<br/>\r<br/>UPDATE:\r<br/>Ported the game to windows successfully (after a whole day of trouble... curse you Microsoft!).

I'm not the best graphics guy but I did my best.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game has also a little story about Joe and his unnamed friend. Their UFO broke and the had to make an emergency landing onto the earth!\r<br/>\r<br/>Making this game took about twenty hours. I used GLBasic because it's a wonderful language for rapid game prototyping and has a powerful 2D and 3D engine included.\r<br/>\r<br/>For 3D modelling and texturing I use Milkshape 3D. For 2D graphics I mainly used Paint.NET but also a little bit of Adobe Photoshop (the titlescreen for example). For sound I used sfxr and for music... wait there is no music at all... I can't make music :(. For planning I used a piece of paper and a pen (what a surprise!).\r<br/>\r<br/>Development was stright forward. There was only one badass bug which didn't want to get fixed (took around 4 hours :(...) Now I hope the game is bugfree, but I don't think so.\r<br/>\r<br/>",

			"htmlDesc": "I made this game in 13 hours, starting from nothing. All of the graphics were made by me, the levels were made by me, and all of the code was made by me.\r<br/>\r<br/>The object of the game is to gather as many coins as you can. You can pass a level by gathering all the coins in the level. When the time runs out, the game ends and you are given a level number, a score, and a total number of coins.\r<br/>\r<br/>The hearts have not been implemented yet. The energy is filled when you eat a cupcake. While there is at least 1 energy left, you can move faster.\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls:\r<br/>W - up\r<br/>A - left\r<br/>S - down\r<br/>D - right\r<br/>\r<br/>Hopefully you guys will appreciate this game as I made it in 13 hours with only 7 months of java experience. This is my first Ludum Dare and I really enjoyed it!\r<br/>\r<br/>Enjoy the game!\r<br/>\r<br/>Made by: Longarmx\r<br/>\r<br/>IMPORTANT: When you unzip the file, the folder renames itself to &quot;bin&quot;!\r<br/>\r<br/>",

Press the back button on your device to return to the world overview.\r<br/>\r<br/>Difficulty:\r<br/>Easy -&gt; small inertia, no spikes\r<br/>Normal, Hard, Impossible -&gt; growing inertia, with spikes.\r<br/>\r<br/>The jar should run fine on all desktops (Win/Mac/Linux) with a Java VM installed.\r<br/>\r<br/>Web&amp;Android ports were done after the compo. The web version should run on recent versions of Firefox and Chrome.  Android version was only tested on my HTC Desire so far. Hopefully works more or less on other devices.\r<br/>\r<br/>Since I couldn't come up with a great idea to fit the theme I just used a small planet as a level/world overview as rationale/excuse.

But how long can you keep this comfortable little existance up for?\r<br/>\r<br/>Not going to give too much away, arrows to move left &amp; right.

I didn't know that Flash Builder deactivates the security sandbox per default, so I was in my little own workspace programming world where everything worked until I deployed and this morning a colleague told me, that my game wasn't working. lololol\r<br/>\r<br/>the old flash link still contains the file, but for real experience, test the fixed version\r<br/>\r<br/>------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Tiny Tim is living on a small world. So small. Soooooo small. And there's nothing to do! Except that he bought himself a car not too long ago, so he spends his time washing it and cleaning it and washing and cleaning .....\r<br/>\r<br/>BOOOOOOOOOOOOORIIIIIIIIIING!!!!!!\r<br/>\r<br/>So he decided to make a race on his planet! And he invited many many many people he didn't even know!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>-------------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>You are playing Tim in his yellow car. When you are online, you should get data of other players, as well as the current highscores\r<br/>\r<br/>There isn't even more to say, except that since your planet is soooo tiny, one lap of the race also flies by like nothing. The only thing that could stop you is your little dog named Doggy because he likes to sit on the street.\r<br/>\r<br/>So: Click with your mouse or press space to jump. Your car must have been bought from a different planet as it is so light that it can jump high into the air. Even twice! (or maybe you're just strong enough that a fistbump into the air is enough ^^)\r<br/>\r<br/>have fun everyone!",

It's a simple top-down exploration game, using the arrow keys for movement. Red things allow you to take control of larger objects, while purple things kick you down another size. Get to the goal in the upper left corner to win!\r<br/>\r<br/>(After a few folks played and hit a bug, I uploaded a fixed version that keeps you from getting stuck in the sliding floor puzzle. If you play the older version, don't go on the bottom-most circle tile, you'll get suck!) ",

Calculate the power of the attack (Value of the card times the energy spent)\r<br/>2. Apply special cases (see below)\r<br/>3. The stronger attack wins and the difference will be subtracted from the loser's health.\r<br/>\r<br/>=========== SPECIAL CASES ===========\r<br/>\r<br/>1. If the two elements are the same, no modification of the attack value happens here.\r<br/>2. If one of the attack is colored, its attack value is multiplied by 2.\r<br/>3. If you fight against a weak element, the attack power of the weak element is added to yours. (you &quot;absorb&quot; the attack) This also means that the enemy's attack power is zeroed out.\r<br/>\r<br/>=========== BATTLE EXAMPLES ===========\r<br/>\r<br/>3 Energy, 2 Fire vs. 1 Energy, 1 Fire\r<br/>\r<br/>Steps (see above):\r<br/>1. 6 Power vs. 1 Power\r<br/>2. No modification\r<br/>3. 5 Damage to the second player\r<br/>\r<br/>5 Energy, 1 Colorless vs. 3 Energy, 1 Water\r<br/>\r<br/>Steps (see above):\r<br/>1. 5 Power vs. 3 Power\r<br/>2. Second Player's Power times 2 (Water vs. Colorless)\r<br/>3. 1 Damage to the first player\r<br/>\r<br/>1 Energy, 1 Fire vs. 5 Energy, 3 Water\r<br/>\r<br/>Steps (see above):\r<br/>1. 1 Power vs. 15 Power\r<br/>2. Second Player's power added to first player's power (Fire vs Water)\r<br/>3. 16 Damage to the second player",

This is my first shot at a game from scratch by myself with\r<br/>minimal planning and experience.\r<br/>If on the other hand you did somehow enjoy this game, then I'm exceptionally happy that\r<br/>it was able to be enjoyable for you.\r<br/>\r<br/>I advise you start of on easy to get a feeling for how the cells and bacterium interact and then once you have the hang of it, try the harder difficulties.\r<br/>\r<br/>the score is based off your remaining life to the power of the difficulty. If you lower your difficulty in game this will affect your score and if you knockup your difficulty ingame, the change will be ignored (as you have a larger lifespan)\r<br/>I've uploaded a screenshot of my current best, feel free to try to top it",

The net gave me a lot of trouble, and I had to remake it like 10 times due to me not understanding blender.\r<br/>- Inkscape to draw the world\r<br/>- paint.net to draw the net, and the guy\r<br/>\r<br/>Theme: one could argue that this game is not much on the theme of a tiny world, and it might be true. It's probably the worst excuse for a &quot;tiny world game&quot; but if I had better drawing skills, the player would be god, playing with the world, and theme would fit it more.\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm very limited by my lack of artistic skills, so I made a game that required as little graphics as possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thank you all for your nice comments.

Survive as long as you can.\r<br/>\r<br/>This game was created in a grand total of 11 hours. It was created in pure Java (it only uses the JLayer library for playing the mp3). See my forthcoming blog post for more information.\r<br/>\r<br/>Use WASD to move around, and aim/fire using the mouse. Create your own levels by making a copy of the map_template.map file in the trapped/maps/ directory, and editing it with a text editor. Please see the included README file for more information.\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks for playing trapped. - Have fun!\r<br/>\r<br/>--\r<br/>\r<br/>Please note, you must have Java installed to play this game. Also, the source is included in the downloads (open the .jar file with WinRAR or similar to view).\r<br/>\r<br/>Last-minute update: fixed some bugs with the Windows and Linux scripts, a bug in the graphics buffering (it wasn't working on some machines) and a bug where the game would launch in a tiny window (this may not actually be fixed - if it occurs, please re-launch the game again).",

Infect other cells and become the dominant species.\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>My interpretation of the theme here was more about the *tiny* than the world, as you can see. I've been thinking on this game for a few weeks, so it was just about time.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game is HEAVILY inspired by Phage Wars and Eufloria. If you don't know them, try them, because they are quite good.\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>The game controls are quite simple:\r<br/>- Move the camera with the arrow keys or WASD\r<br/>- Left Click to select a cell\r<br/>- Right Click to send viruses from the selected cell\r<br/>- Keys 1, 2 and 3 control which types of viruses you send:\r<br/>  + If none is pressed, all types are selected\r<br/>  + If at least one key is pressed, only those types associated are sent. 1=Triangles, 2=Squares, 3=Circles\r<br/>\r<br/>Cells with a shape inside them generate mostly that kind of virus. Each type of virus has a different ability:\r<br/>\r<br/>* Triangles deal more damage and reduce the enemy's defense\r<br/>* Squares increase the defense of a cell\r<br/>* Circles increase the reproduction rate of a cell\r<br/>\r<br/>The AI is really simple and basically plays randomly. I might or might not improve the AI after rating has ended.\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>APPLET ISSUES:\r<br/>Some people can play on the applet, some people can't.\r<br/>To be precise: The applet crashes on my laptop (Ubuntu 11.10, Java7), but works on my father's (Win7, Java6).\r<br/>Just try...\r<br/>\r<br/>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:\r<br/>Download the &quot;Binaries&quot; distribution from the link section and unzip it to any location. It is important to unzip it, it won't work otherwise.\r<br/>After that, just double click the JAR file. If you are on Mac/Linux, you might need to give it execution permissions before.\r<br/>\r<br/>If it doesn't launch, execute ir from the console as:\r<br/>java -jar LD23-Darkhogg-TinyInfection.jar\r<br/>\r<br/>You might see an error. If is says something about &quot;libjawt.so&quot;, I'm on it. If you know how to fix it, PLEASE, PLEASE contact me. If it says something about the jar/native versions, I'm also on it. I don't really know what is it, but I'll look into it.\r<br/>\r<br/>THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE.",

You will have no chance against them (if there is no bug) but you can try to beat your highscore.

You made fun on him and you told that his story is stupid. For revenge, the old strange man threw you a curse and made you prisoner of the cube. It's your punishment and now you have you to pass the tests of the cube to hope to get out.\r<br/>\r<br/>PS: It was my first LD so... not enough experiences and a bad overall organisation, only level 1 and 3 are playable... have fun anyway! : D\r<br/>\r<br/>About my theme interpretation, i think it's: There is no tiny world. A tiny world can be huge, it's all about point of view.\r<br/>\r<br/>Concerning the controls:\r<br/>\r<br/>Move with arrows.\r<br/>Jump with SPACE.\r<br/>Action key is X.\r<br/>To pass the very awful scenario text, press space :)\r<br/>\r<br/>About the goal of the game:\r<br/>\r<br/>It was planned to add some in game indications but i was not done always due to the lake of time. So, to end up the game (escape the cube); you need to complete the six levels (in the version i released for the compo, you can only play on level one and three). However, this is not a linear game, in each level you have what i called a &quot;console&quot; (a super interrupter) that needs a key to be activated, those key are hidden in levels. You start the game with the red key. To clear a level, you just need to find the &quot;super-interrupter&quot; and activate it.\r<br/>I hope it's clearer now : D",

The image we had for him was to be an angry drunk that wanders through his tiny world (business district and trailer park) to eventually find out that it wasnt so small after all.\r<br/>\r<br/>We had imagined using beer for health; he would drink one to refresh himself, and also beer for ammo; he would throw projectile beer at enemies.\r<br/>\r<br/>Some of the enemies we had planned on really pushed some stereotypes. We had condescending monocle-clad businessmen, hurried white collar workers eager to push him out of the way as the bustle to and from their apparently stressful jobs, hoards of children that cried &quot;daddy&quot; as he tried to evade them in the trailer park, his super-butch bearded wife who wields babies by their umbilical cords, a half dozen girlfriends who are angry at him because he never calls, a half dozen boyfriends who are angry at him because of the way he is with their girlfriends.\r<br/>\r<br/>What we ended up with was a lovely tiny world that we call the &quot;Hub World&quot;, its round, you can walk all the way around its circumference. This world acts as a hub for all the other worlds and shops we had initially planned.\r<br/>\r<br/>We got basic gameplay in, with no real goal in the end. We had planned boss fights and pickups, collectibles.\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun!",

I have never made a game before, so this was an interesting adventure and I learned quite a bit; so I am pleased. I have heard before that the first game a person makes should be an MMO, and that makes a lot of sense really. So I made an MMO!\r<br/>\r<br/>Adhering to the Tiny World theme, this is a tiny MMO (as far as MMOs go). As small as possible, actually, since to be fair I have no experience in making MMOs. Or any kind of game for that matter. I made the game with JavaScript and HTML to make playing it more accessible [it is, afterall, an MMO!].\r<br/>\r<br/>The client was made with the following dependencies:\r<br/>-Twitter's Bootstrap CSS library\r<br/>-John Resig's JQuery JavaScript library\r<br/>-Guillermo Rauch's Socket.IO JavaScript library\r<br/>-Tomas Pettersson's sfxr\r<br/>\r<br/>And on the server, I used:\r<br/>-Ryan Dahl's node.js server\r<br/>-TJ Holowaychuk's Express plugin for node.js\r<br/>-Guillermo Rauch's Socket.IO plugin for node.js\r<br/>-Tom Gallacher's gzippo plugin for node.js\r<br/>-Ben Smawfield's Sanitizer plugin for node.js\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks to all the above people!\r<br/>\r<br/>In the game, you play as a single coloured pixel in a small 2D world. Your goal as a pixel is simply to kill players of colours other than your own. In addition to this core Player-vs-Player mechanic, the game features real-time world chat so that you may taunt your opponents!\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope the game's server does not catch fire while I sleep.\r<br/>\r<br/>Good night, tiny world.",

Therefore, you must play the game at least 2 times (The first time is against a dummy) to get the other mage firing back.  \r<br/>\r<br/>IMPORTANT NOTE #2 - The game is in XNA 4.0.

Resources for the game are made in Adobe Photoshop Elements and sfxr.\r<br/>\r<br/>Most of the code was written during the competition, however, I copied some of the basic code from my earlier projects.

The game might lag down..\r<br/>\r<br/>With huds, camera, limited to 4 ships per team: http://bluecodestudio.com/ludumdare23/airrider23_player_v2.swf\r<br/>\r<br/>Only CPU: http://bluecodestudio.com/ludumdare23/airrider23_cpu.swf\r<br/>\r<br/>*/\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Link to the high-res screenshot: http://bluecodestudio.com/ludumdare23/screenshot.png\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The game ins't finished. The plan is to implement some kind of towers on each base, that would be the ones that power the bases. In order to conquer your enemy's base, you should take down those towers, and stand on that base.\r<br/>\r<br/>It also lacks a hud showing the HP and the energy in order to shoot. I wanted to add a XP and improvement system too.\r<br/>\r<br/>However, for the little time I had this weekend, I'm quite satisfied with the result.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>All the content is mine except for some sound effects. The background music is also mine, made with GarageBand.\r<br/>\r<br/>I hope you like it!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Made with Flash, AS3.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>//Notes edit\r<br/>\r<br/>Okay, I feel like I should explain something more.\r<br/>\r<br/>How does it shoot? You can only shoot if there's an enemy ship close to you, so if you can't make it shoot, just try to get closer to the enemy's ship.\r<br/>\r<br/>Even though there's not a HUD, ships have HP and a reload time. So you don't need to spam the spacebar, because it's not going to shoot faster. You can even hold it down, and it will shoot when possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>You can also just look and enjoy the AI.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The game gets slow after some time, and other bugs and lacks, but I prefer not to modify my entry until the judgement periode has ended. I hope you like the game! Thanks for the comments!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>//Okay, EXTRA DESCRIPTION\r<br/>\r<br/>What is this game? Even though I aimed for more (but I hadn't the time to achieve it), the result is an endless battle between two factions. It WON'T end.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can just try to survive while killing enemy ships. With a little of practice, you will figure out (more or less) how projectiles move and, therefore, it will be more easy to avoid them. (Just a bit)\r<br/>\r<br/>So you might have some great moments, like luckily avoiding 5 bullets that were on your tail, and you'll feel like a badass X-Wing pilot.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>//Goodie!\r<br/>\r<br/>The background track is uploaded right here: http://soundcloud.com/airrider3/premiere\r<br/>\r<br/>It is not finished, but I had to use something, so...\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>//Additional information!\r<br/>\r<br/>- The screen size (SWF stage size) is 960x640, the same as the iPhone Retina screen in landscape mode, as I was hoping to release it for iOS and Android too. But time didn't help.\r<br/>\r<br/>- For getting the key events, I always use a class I made a year ago. If anyone's curious, it's also included on the source, though there are different versions of it, and there's not a read me, instructions, or anything because it hasn't been released yet. Maybe this summer.\r<br/>\r<br/>- The map was initially a floating island. A tiny world. An idea was being able to conquer bases along different planets on a system. Maybe even on different systems.\r<br/>\r<br/>- You can follow me on Twitter at @AirRider3",

I'm not one of those people.\r<br/>\r<br/>Update: Added option to change mouse sensitivity by pressing &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; keys. And, removed power-ups for debugging, and, moved another power up I forgot to move. Hope it's ok, and not a horrible cheating.\r<br/>\r<br/>Made with Unity + monodevelop, paint.net, and bfxr + audacity.\r<br/>6th secret spoiler http://minus.com/mMAYVeGmu/1f",

Press space bar when in range of asteroids to anchor them to your ship. Bring them back to your planet and press space again to release them in orbit. Asteroids increase your resources, which increase your military might.  \r<br/> \r<br/>Be alert for the corrupt larger worlds trying to build roads through your tiny world. Follow the dotted lines back to their worlds and set up trade agreements to stop the roads, or attack with the full force of your tiny worlds military might. \r<br/> \r<br/>You can also drag space hippies from your planets orbit using the space key and place them within range of planets building spaceways to delay the building of a road while you build up your trade or military numbers.\r<br/>\r<br/>Update : We have an installer but it doesn't seem to work for everyone, we tried a bunch of things and it works here, not sure what else to do.",

I am purposely not posting any how-to because the game is designed to be intuitive.\r<br/>\r<br/>PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU GET STUCK, MENTALLY OR GAME-BROKEN-LY.\r<br/>\r<br/>We only had 48 hours to do this (we work on Mondays, duh), so the levels don't get as deep as I'd like and there is some placeholder art (mainly the gorilla has only 2 frames of animation). But I think we did what we set out to do.\r<br/>\r<br/>&quot;We&quot; is...\r<br/>\r<br/>Eli Delventhal (demonpants) on code, game design, level design\r<br/>Seth Robles on art and game design\r<br/>Mario Godoy on musix\r<br/>sfxr on sound effects ;-)\r<br/>\r<br/>Please enjoy! Rate it all 5s!\r<br/>\r<br/>=======\r<br/>\r<br/>If you're stuck, a walkthrough:\r<br/>\r<br/>World 1 -\r<br/>Throw a bone to hit the switch, wait for the rabbit to eat the carrot (get good karma), kill yourself, walk clockwise to the goal.\r<br/>\r<br/>World 2 -\r<br/>Walk clockwise and press the switches in the order: dirt, seed, water, sun to grow the tree. Walk counter-clockwise and hit the switch to feed the rabbit behind you. Walk into the spikes to kill yourself. Jump over the spikes to the goal.\r<br/>\r<br/>World 3 -\r<br/>Jump clockwise onto the raised platform above the rabbit. Walk right until it falls, killing the rabbit below. Keep heading clockwise onto the spikes to kill yourself. Walk counter-clockwise to the goal.\r<br/>\r<br/>World 4 -\r<br/>Walk clockwise and go up the hill. Drop down. Notice the two saplings. Walk counter-clockwise under the hill and hit the switch. Jump back counter-clockwise to where you started. Keep going counter-clockwise until your are past the rabbit and on top of a platform with a ramp going down counter-clockwise. Jump clockwise onto the raised platform, keep running and do another jump. Wait for the spike ball, then jump again. Finally, jump up and clockwise to hit a switch on the top of World 3. This feeds the rabbit. Now drop down and go counter-clockwise down that ramp. Platform up this section, avoiding the spike ball. When you get to the top, head clockwise first, and walk clockwise (don't jump). You'll drop onto a platform with a switch. Now that you have 3 karma kill yourself. Hold space and press left on the keyboard to push the block down. Keep walking counter-clockwise up the hill to the goal.\r<br/>\r<br/>World 3 part 2 -\r<br/>Walk counter-clockwise until you're at a tree. Don't proceed counter-clockwise to the trees, instead go up the ramp by walking back clockwise. Push the block down onto the switch to feed all 4 rabbits. Then go counter-clockwise to the goal.\r<br/>\r<br/>World 5 - Kill yourself on the spikes. If you do not have 4 good karma from the rabbits on the previous world, then you can never make it to heaven. Walk into the spikes. Walk into the goal.\r<br/>\r<br/>HEAVEN!

There is no sound as A) suck at making mods B) MaxMod had a fit with all my poor coding and made all the sound effects crackly.\r<br/>\r<br/>There is also a graphical glitch which kind ruins the whole game for me and I tried so many things to try and fix it. The planets will suddenly pop out of no where are also become huge squares. This is cause by the way that the GBA handles objects on the screen. Rather than going to -1 in the x it actually wraps round to 511 which I do checks for and have it all set up to cut them out after a set distance but they seem to enjoy ignoring it.\r<br/>\r<br/>Other Notes Save and Map doesn't work since the planets are always in the incorrect places and I didnt get round to sorting out the memory copy to the SRAM and I dont know how to set the make file to clear the SRAM to what I want on each build.\r<br/>\r<br/>I think I did the worst thing you can do for this event: go to work, use a low end bit of hardware and try and make a complex game haha.\r<br/>\r<br/>Any way have fun. emulators included if you wish to use them",

I know its not that fun without them but I tried my best and if only I wasn't so sick. Have fun playing it, though. \r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: Feeling much better today, I managed to add the little bit of code required to add working cops and pedestrians (even though they are extremely primitive and buggy). I didn't manage to add any music or sound though as I still am extremely sick and even went to the ER yesterday on account of a very high fever. I am feeling better today, my throat still hurts like a b**** though.  I didn't add any sound because that would be going out of my comfort zone unlike coding which is quite relaxing. I am keeping the original game, on here though, as it is what I managed to finish before the deadline. But, if you don't consider updating the game cheating, or simply want to play the new version, which i recommend you do as it is much better, you can. \r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE: The Web version is the new version, all the others are the original.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also this game was made using Flixel and Flixel Powertools, which are both great and extremely useful.",

Our team absorbed a lot of knowledge in these three days of Jamming.\r<br/>\r<br/>The &quot;tiny world&quot; theme inspired us to unite the most classic platform games into one, mixing them with funny images and story.\r<br/>\r<br/>Although our team hadn't had the best design and organization, we made a creative game with the resources we had (XNA and Photoshop), wich was really hard to accomplish, due to excessive programmers and lack of artists.\r<br/>\r<br/>We would like to thank Ludum Dare for having organized this competition for free. Even though we had some boring discussions along the development (due to spending too many hours with too many men in the same house), it was very fun of challenging ourselves to finish a game in 72 hours.\r<br/>\r<br/>Cheers from Brazil,\r<br/>\r<br/>Fluence Games.",

First of all is the unit movement. Due to limited time and complexity of the movement, units are fairly solitary and will queue up all attempting to reach the same spot without flocking around the target position.\r<br/>\r<br/>Secondly is the simplicity. I'd have liked to add more types of units, better upgrades, more balanced upgrade system, building more units, strategic enemies, etc.\r<br/>\r<br/>Last off all is community. I didn't manage to stream as much as I'd hoped I could, nor post as much as I'd have liked either. Too busy developing this :P",

If you jump too far, you may escape the gravitational pull of the planets around you and drift into space forever! \r<br/>\r<br/>Three levels take you from learning the basics to avoiding hazard (a sun) and then finally requiring you to slingshot around the sun to get to the other side.",

Music is the fuel here.\r<br/>\r<br/>Each note you grab, a new piece of the music kicks in! After grabbing 3 notes, you can move on to the next planet.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my first time in Ludum Dare. The idea here was to make the game more music-focused, but more or less halfway there I had to worry more about refining gameplay and gameflow to make the experience more interesting - given the short development time. SO I used the same music on all three levels.\r<br/>\r<br/>I also ran into technical issues: I had to upload the game to a friend's website (thanks Al Anselmo!) because in mine the sound is off (need to change some host configs that I am not capable of by myself).\r<br/>\r<br/>This was built using Construct 2 (Engine), Propellerhead Reason (Music) and Demo Photoshop (Images).

			"htmlDesc": "The theme of this ludum dare event was &quot;tiny world&quot;, so I created a game with virusses and immune globulines.\r<br/>\r<br/>Time used: 24 - 26 hours\r<br/>\r<br/>Frameworks used: lycheeJS (http://github.com/martensms/lycheeJS)\r<br/>\r<br/>Sounds / Voices used: Command and Conquer Tiberium Dawn. They were made public for the huge modding community some years ago.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>The concept:\r<br/>\r<br/>You can either play the virus team or the immune system team (Main Menu &gt; Settings!). You have two Computer players taking part in the game. One is neutral and controlled passively by the Immune System. This neutral Computer is the one that controls the leucocytes that are controlled by the interleucines (produced by the globulines) and will attack the cells that are under control by the virus team. The viruses spawn rate is higher than the spawn rate of the immune system, but virusses are stronger than globulines.\r<br/>\r<br/>The immune system player is the one that is defensive, but he can also attack with &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; strategy and making the virus team busy whilst using his leucocytes bonus.\r<br/>\r<br/>The virus player is the one that is aggressive, he is the one that has to infect as much cells as possible. The more time he has, the stronger he gets and the harder it is for the counterpart to eliminate the virus player.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>TL;DR\r<br/>\r<br/>Have a look at the settings, where you can set which team you want to play. Also, there is a PRO Mode for guys that enjoyed games like &quot;I wanna be the guy&quot; or SuperMeatBoy in the past :) You have to be really good and fast to have a chance against the computer counterpart. It automatically turns the tutorial at the beginning of.\r<br/>\r<br/>The one that infects all cells has won. You've got to catch them all :)\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>POST-MORTEM-WORK:\r<br/>\r<br/>Well, I did a lot of refactoring the code meanwhile. The path algorithm behind is now much smarter and caches commonly used paths. Also, the clustering is now a self-generated cluster. There is no hitmap or collision model used by the path algorithm, I'm using an own path system here - because I think A-Star and common hitmaps are the false way to go. Meaning there are no manually set paths, everything generated by shapes. Play the roundabout skirmish map to see what's up :)\r<br/>\r<br/>The AI / COM is also very smart. Now being able to be set to different modes (aggressive, defensive, passive) and with different strengths.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, I decided to move the levels to a campaign-style game. For now, only the Immune system's campaign is working - due to undone refactoring of code :)\r<br/>\r<br/>Take a look at the post-mortem game (requires a Web Console! Firefox + Firebug or Chrome or IE with F12 (DevTools)):\r<br/>\r<br/>http://martens.ms/lycheeJS/demo/game/immune/\r<br/>",

Watch out for your energy orbs as they drain out quickly depending where you fly. Luckily there are some power orbs to collect.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game does not follow the LD23 theme, instead it is heavily inspired by a picture that posted on the TIGSource forums. Unfortunately we could not find the original post.\r<br/>\r<br/>We used www.Love2d.org together with Hump and Quickie which was extremely productive (thanks vrld!). Art, Music, Level Editor, and Sound were created from scratch with tools like Inkscape, sfxr and Milkytracker.\r<br/>\r<br/>Notes for the editor:\r<br/>You can switch which layer to modify using F1 - F4 and select the powerups with F5-F8. Return lets you test the game. Due to sandboxing of Love2d, it will save the levels in the directory specified at https://love2d.org/wiki/love.filesystem.\r<br/>\r<br/>Have fun!\r<br/>",

Choosing JavaScript was done lightly but in retrospect I should have put more time into the decision, especially since my only familiarity with JawsJS was briefly looking at the API docs. The theme resonated deeply with my memories of being a child and playing a Nintendo GameBoy, with it being 'tiny' but packing such a large 'world' of adventures and exploration.

Spending a night in the apartment\r<br/> building with their significant other gives the women a chance to become\r<br/> pregnant and after a &quot;game-ticks&quot; period of pregnancy they head to the\r<br/> hospital for delivery, giving birth to a healthy young boy/girl, and the circle of\r<br/> life is complete. Watch out though, your humans never know when their \r<br/>&quot;life-ticks&quot; runs out, and if they loose all their money they're heading back to\r<br/> the train station to seek their fortune elsewhere. Complete with annoying\r<br/> looping soundtrack.\r<br/>\r<br/>*update* \r<br/>Ok, so I kind of makde it demaning a device running Android 3.0. \r<br/>Also the display is super tweaked for my Galaxy Nexus so you just \r<br/>might get displaced sprites ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>The &gt;1.6 apk should at least not complain on devices starting from 1.6 \r<br/>and beyond.

Useful to drop harvesters on the enemy this way, hint hint.\r<br/>-Nuke destroys all enemy harvesters etc.\r<br/>\r<br/>Good LD this time enjoy everyone etc.\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: Why didn't /anyone/ tell me the game wasn't working on their machines?\r<br/>\r<br/>I uploaded the working one post-deadline.  There's no changes except that it's actually packaged correctly so now it'll run on machines that don't already have XNA installed.  Hopefully that's alright? :&lt;\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT 2: Well, it works now.  But there's a pretty game-breaking bug where the enemy would freeze if he hit a generator.\r<br/>\r<br/>I've uploaded the fixed version but for the sake of honesty the old one is still up.  For the compo I'd recommend you judge based on that one.",

I used Notepad++ to code and as tools Paint.NET, MS Paint and the Tiled Mapeditor. Sorry for no sound, but I didnt want this to trouble me in my first Ludum Dare.

			"htmlDesc": "Mineral  Cities is a city-building, resource-management optimisation game inspired by my fond memories of SimCity sprawl, the LD48-23 theme and a game of 7 Wonders on Friday night.\r<br/>\r<br/>Primary control is of the tiny world itself (cursors or WASD), with the number keys 1 to 4 building either grass, water, hills or cities.\r<br/>\r<br/>When built close to each other, those features produce resource based on their dependencies (e.g. grass needs water, water hills, cities both water and grass). Each feature costs a different amount to produce.\r<br/>\r<br/>Production slows to a total of 5 iterations, but can be restarted by building something new nearby.\r<br/>\r<br/>-------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Cities get more expensive each time you build one...\r<br/>\r<br/>...but cities are the only way of obtaining minerals (just build a city on top of some minerals).\r<br/>\r<br/>Over-arching progress is in accumulation of minerals. There are 50 mineral spots each time you play -- and they can be harvested by as many cities as you can get close enough (3 in most cases, 4 if you're very careful).\r<br/>\r<br/>Because the cities get more expensive, your play tactics and overall strategy have to adapt during the course of play.\r<br/>\r<br/>-------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>I'm enjoying the play curve, though looking forward to getting some feedback from others -- I've generally been using the following tactics:\r<br/>\r<br/>- leave gaps (go in and build hills there later to restart production)\r<br/>- cluster around dependencies (e.g. grass around water)\r<br/>- be patient (don't restart production until it's over, as you'll waste valuable cycles)\r<br/>- cities themselves can earn a lot of money, use them wisely (don't build just because you can)\r<br/>\r<br/>Would love to hear someone prove out the math at the top end -- I've played this through on the final build to just over 20 minerals.\r<br/>\r<br/>-------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Some background on what was used:\r<br/>\r<br/>- Unity (first project in Unity -- generally pretty happy with it)\r<br/>- Propellerhead's Figure (iOS synth) + Audacity for the background music\r<br/>- Cfxr + Audactiy for the sound fx\r<br/>- &quot;Cheri&quot; font, Illustrator for instructions page\r<br/>- Lots of lemsips\r<br/>\r<br/>-------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>Easter egg: if you're using WASD, you can also use Q and E to &quot;roll&quot; the tiny world.",

I was writing the game basically from scratch in Processing with a bit of a leg up using my QEngine game template. We were not able to finish much of a game by the jam deadline as planned, but we've got art, animation, music, sound, collision, player movement, and gunfire implemented. So this is to show you what we were able to accomplish in around 68 hours of work with one artist and one programmer. You can still play this as a traversal game - try to navigate the maze to get to the core of the planet!\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>Move: Arrow keys\r<br/>Shoot: x\r<br/>Jump: z\r<br/>\r<br/>You may need to click the window after the game has loaded before input will be accepted.\r<br/>\r<br/>Credits:\r<br/>Art, Level Design - Daniel Adams\r<br/>Programming, Sound Design - Eliot Lash\r<br/>Music - Optomon",

You have the antidotes with the same color as the virus. To kill one you should kill all its colors. But beware - if you try to kill it with the wrong antidote the virus will consume the color and become stronger.\r<br/>\r<br/>Use WASD to move, SPACE to change color, Mouse to point and shoot. \r<br/>\r<br/>Mechanics Details: The current color is put around the screen, around yourself and it is used to fire at the enemies. You change it with 'space'. If an enemy is hit with a color one of the following can happen:\r<br/> - If the enemy already contains this color it will be removed (i.e. its health will be decreased)\r<br/> - If the enemy does not contain this color it will assimilate it (i.e. its health will be increased)\r<br/>\r<br/>(Sorry, no time for music or beautiful graphics)",

Smash into objects smaller than you to grow in size, and grow large enough to take down the Earth itself.\r<br/>\r<br/>The further away you go from the Earth the larger the planets get, there are also &quot;occupied&quot; planets which will shoot you down, knocking chunks of your mass off.\r<br/>\r<br/>This is our first ever game for Ludum Dare, entered into the Jam purely because my friend and I wanted to do our first one in a team.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls are simply the arrow keys. Q and W zoom the camera in and out, but it should do that automatically based on your size anyway. Flixel has built in sound controls, so 0 to mute (and unmute).\r<br/>\r<br/>Made in AS3 using a slightly modified Flixel. Photoshop for the art work, though as you may guess none of us were artists.Sound Effects made in as3sfxr. And Music was free to use music by BunnyMajs of Newgrounds.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you all enjoy!",

			"htmlDesc": "This is my first Ludum Dare entry! I made this with Python, pyglet and pymunk, and all of the art is original.\r<br/>\r<br/>-----\r<br/>\r<br/>You find yourself stuck on a tiny island, with nothing but strange, happy looking boxes to keep you company. But when a hoard of crazed, exploding[1] space bees appears, even that is on the line!\r<br/>\r<br/>Fortunately, there happen to be some more benign, colourful boxes falling from the sky, and there's one thing the space bees didn't expect: you spent twenty years playing Tetris *for a reason*.\r<br/>\r<br/>Guide the falling blocks to protect your happy, green-coloured pals! Maybe the bees will get bored and go away, eventually.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/> - Left and Right arrow keys to guide the current block.\r<br/> - Down arrow to make the block fall (slightly) faster.\r<br/> - Space to release the block.\r<br/> - If you really don't want a block, just move it off the edge of the screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>[1] Actual, visible, gooey explosions were cut due to time constraints. They're just ideas of explosions now, so use your imagination.\r<br/>\r<br/>-----\r<br/>\r<br/>Unfortunately, one thing I didn't have time for (if you haven't noticed the performance) was testing / developing in Windows. The exe file should just work, but it seems Pyglet is a little less widely compatible than I was hoping. Leave a comment if it works. I'm interested to know. But if it's handy for you, there's a better chance of having fun with the Linux version :)\r<br/>\r<br/>-----\r<br/>\r<br/>If you're curious for some reason, here's the stuff I had left to do that I would have liked to do:\r<br/> - Actually formidable space bees that fly properly (and aren't fighting with the physics engine).\r<br/> - Sound effects.\r<br/> - Explosion effects.\r<br/> - Cleverer falloff for explosions.\r<br/> - Block shattering effects.\r<br/> - Better performance. Right now it gets really slow once a few blocks have been created (about two minute's worth). This is mostly because I completely ignored memory management until the last minute.\r<br/> - Different types of attackers (things on foot, sticky bees, better flying bees, explodey ones that reliably shatter blocks).\r<br/> - An arrow at the edge of the screen pointing at incoming attack waves.\r<br/> - Special properties for different types of blocks.\r<br/>\r<br/>So, yeah, look at that list and imagine the exciting game that isn't. Then enjoy this one! I'm happy with it, too.",

You must send as many refuges away from Earth as you can, before the planet is dead and humankind with it. Oh, and you have, like, 3 minutes.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>How to play:\r<br/>As soon as you pop into the game, Earth is quickly becoming a wasteland. \r<br/>\r<br/>A/D/Left/Right: Move left/right along the solar system.\r<br/>Space: Launch a rocketship with colonists from Earth\r<br/>S: Launch a seed ship with resources from Earth\r<br/>(debug) P: Restart game, so you don't have to close/reopen\r<br/>\r<br/>The Point:\r<br/>Save as many people from Earth as possible, the game ends when Earth dies. Your score is the number (in Millions) of people who are not on Earth at that time. People in ships don't count (to prevent cheating by launching to nowhere at the last moment). Have it planned. The game is meant to be played in about 2-3 minute attempts.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Sadly, I did not finish what I set out to do. I did not have the time on Sunday I had planned, so now I am releasing what I have. It is &quot;gameplay complete&quot;, it plays, and there is a start and finish. \r<br/>\r<br/>What isn't included:\r<br/>Sound\r<br/>Music\r<br/>High score keeping\r<br/>Help instructions\r<br/>Aesthetics (proper graphics, backgrounds)\r<br/>Better UI\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>I (luckily) had prototyped out my game on Saturday, so the gameplay is actually there.\r<br/>\r<br/>What is included:\r<br/>Windows executable and source code, of course. The source is a Unity project, it will generate an OSX app without issue, though I haven't included one here. \r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>Tips:\r<br/>Ships take time to reach their destinations, and also cost resources. With Earths resources already dwindling, you must balance out population growth on multiple planets to save as many people as possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>If a planet hits 0 resources, all colonists die.

It also keeps you from just collecting germs in the beginning where white blood cells can't hit you.

If you ever run out of food, you lose.\r<br/>\r<br/>Buildings:\r<br/>Mason's: costs 3 stone, 1 wood. Produces stone from surrounding mountains, consumes food.\r<br/>Woodcutter's: 3 stone, 1 wood. Produces wood from surrounding forests, consumes food.\r<br/>Farm: 3 stone, 2 wood. Plants fields in surrounding empty space, produces grain.\r<br/>Windmill: 5 stone, 3 wood. Consumes grain, produces food. Each produces enough food to feed a single mason or woodcutter.\r<br/>Castle: 40 wood, 40 stone. Building a castle and amassing 40 food wins you the game.\r<br/>\r<br/>Known bugs:\r<br/>The windmill is missing its blades in the radial menu.\r<br/>The radial menu is impossible to close without building something.\r<br/>\r<br/>No sound, sorry.",

In space!\r<br/>\r<br/>INSTRUCTIONS:\r<br/>\r<br/>When it's your turn you can press left or right to line up your shot and hold space bar to begin your throw. The sooner you let go of the space bar, the faster you'll throw it. So if you want to knock someone out of position, let go immediately. If you want a short-range throw for a defensive position, hold on for a second or two.\r<br/>\r<br/>Once the brooms come out you can mash the space bar to reduce friction and keep the rock rolling. In short, sweep if you want to go faster. At any point after you've thrown you can hit the left or right arrow keys to steer in that direction.\r<br/>\r<br/>The player with the rock closest to the middle of the house (the target at the end) wins! Good curling, and thanks for playing!\r<br/>\r<br/>Game programmed with Flixel - http://flixel.org\r<br/>Audio programmed with Shaun Inman's TextMate MML Bundle - http://shauninman.com/archive/2010/02/13/an_mml_bundle_for_textmate/",

			"htmlDesc": "Our ship is called the Kumiho, or nine-tailed fox in Korean. It has the spirit of a spirit-fox inside her. \r<br/>She will need to use her special telekinetic ability to the max, to make it out alive through this beautiful, once peaceful world, with enemies inspired by out of proportion animals and Korean mythology.\r<br/>\r<br/>The story is that Mako the Progenitress Goddess has, out of anger, transformed the world into a speck of dirt. All creatures became half-organic half-metal entities, and only one Kumiho decided to battle against Mako's will, to save nature, becoming a ship herself. An evil 9-tail-fox spirit, the unlikely savior of the planet.\r<br/>\r<br/>The way it ties in with the theme &quot;Tiny World&quot; is that the enemies are transformed wasps and bumblebees, and a flying squid. The Kumiho is a tiny ship.\r<br/>\r<br/>Play with\r<br/>Arrow keys &gt; movement\r<br/>Z &gt; fire weapons\r<br/>X &gt; teleport a short distance towards the direction you are pressing OR\r<br/>if you're not pressing any cursor keys, you're given the choice of 4 directions to teleport to. It's easier than it sounds.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>A real test of what you can do in 3 days, with true pixelart graphics (only 21 colors used).\r<br/>Loosely inspired by Korean mythology, this bullet-hell shmup was lovingly crafted by\r<br/>\r<br/>Fedor Jutte ( did amazing coding and awesome level design )\r<br/>\r<br/>and\r<br/>\r<br/>Christina Antoinette Neofotistou ( made the graphics, animation and composed/performed the music )\r<br/>\r<br/>We used Unity, Adobe Photoshop CS5 and Fruity Loops\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>You can learn more about the art development here:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/04/29/assets-and-timelapse/",

If it does not run, or gives some sort of XNA error, you MUST use the installer instead (or install XNA).  This happens because you cannot run the application without the XNA dependencies, and if you do not have them the installer will get them for you.\r<br/>\r<br/>PLEASE READ the readme either linked above or included in the downloads.  It's not a long read at all and has all of the information about the game you need to know what's going on.\r<br/>----\r<br/>\r<br/>You are a bacterium struggling to survive, thrive, and evolve.  Attack other bacteria with a variety of weapons, get a variety of upgrades and buffs, and for goodness' sake watch out for bacteriophages.\r<br/>\r<br/>The controls are explained more in the readme, but here's the short version:\r<br/>Mouse - target\r<br/>Left click - move towards mouse\r<br/>Space - bite\r<br/>C/V/B (configurable) - use active abilities\r<br/>Escape - Open/close upgrade menu, which also has keybinding and sound control\r<br/>\r<br/>Some people have reported that biting is rather difficult, so I advise tracking your target with the mouse first, and using it to swim towards them secondarily.  It doesn't really matter your orientation or position as long as you're close enough, mouse-over-ing them, and pressing space.  Hope that helps you all who are having trouble.\r<br/>\r<br/>Combat, short version: &quot;mouse over bacteria and hit space to bite&quot; -racarate.  It might take a bit to get used to the controls.",

Your &quot;tiny&quot; world is populated with a huge diversity of intelligent races (none of which are even important on this scale), who restore its power and integrity, as enigmatic alien structures of even greater sizes roam around and perpetually attack. Unit integrity and energy depend on the inner systems that collapse over time, weakening the inhabitants, and the whole defensive logic. Only you can expand the systems to fix this, but your fight with the universal enthropy will never end.\r<br/>\r<br/>Your goal is to protect the unit for as long as possible, making your way through humanly unimaginable times and spaces. Your single step is thousands of years.\r<br/>\r<br/>Equanimity.\r<br/>\r<br/>P. S. Well, this game actually looks so much more like micro-world than macro-world. But wait, how can you tell?!",

You get what I'm saying.\r<br/>\r<br/>Try to gather 200 ants before the time runs out !\r<br/>\r<br/>- ants pickup food (berries and sugar)\r<br/>- if they bring it back to a heap, more ants will come\r<br/>- create bounding boxes to keep them in a certain area\r<br/>- use your boxes wisely, sometimes it's better to just let them run arround\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>-- UPDATE --\r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks for the comments so far, here's a quick apology on why the game is so short.\r<br/>I tried to implement different levels so you could get the hang of how the boxes would react and what the better tactics were. But unfortunately I ran out of time leaving the game without levels but with a few bugs. Those bugs are:\r<br/>\r<br/>- once the food recource is gone all remaining recources (if the ants are still carrying them) won't spawn any new ants.\r<br/>- when you deselect a tile the collision detection fails horribly and warps ants at the border to an adjacent tile.\r<br/>\r<br/>For those who are interested, I'll try to upload a fixed and an enhanced version somewhere this weekend.\r<br/>\r<br/>-- THANKS FOR PLAYING --\r<br/>",

Depending on the material, the bounciness isn't the same.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you press number pad &quot;5&quot; key, you'll gain access to the initial gameplay : using the UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to control the right hand and the A(or Q)/Z (or W)/S/D to control the left hand. You can only move things by moving both hands onto the material. While both the hands are overlapping the material, you can move it. Beak apart the double overlapping and the material will fall.\r<br/>\r<br/>---KNOWN ISSUES---\r<br/>Sometimes, when there are too much sprites on the screen, the game can freeze.\r<br/>There's no game over (neither by winning or losing)\r<br/>Some strange collisions with the Drag&amp;Drop control\r<br/>Not a lot of variety with the sounds (no time)",

Any feedback or shameless promotion is more than welcome :D :D\r<br/>\r<br/>*********Thanks!!***********\r<br/>\r<br/>How to Play\r<br/>You start with 1 bee, click to send him out. Collect pollen to get more bees.\r<br/>\r<br/>Click twice if you want to send out 2 bees (if you have 2 bees) or 3 times for 3 bees etc (No limit on number of bees) \r<br/>\r<br/>Bees are deaf, so there's no sound (this could be a lie to justify not adding sound).\r<br/>\r<br/>I'll be adding more to this after the jam so if you like it there'll be updates at:\r<br/>\r<br/>http://www.triplevisiongames.tumblr.com \r<br/>\r<br/>You can also check out 'By Candlelight&quot;, which is a work in progress (and me learning to design, draw and use XNA/C#)",

Blast out the baddies, pick up power-ups to aid your journey and try to get rid of as many of them as fast as possible.\r<br/>\r<br/>Be careful though, you can't let 5 or more of them to pass you, or your host organism fails!\r<br/>\r<br/>-------------------------------------------------\r<br/>\r<br/>It was one tough of a compo, took me nearly 9 hours from the beginning to get an idea(after sleeping a few hours), but it was well worth it. The code is full of makeshift solutions, which I believe is the point of this compo :D\r<br/>\r<br/>I was going to add a final boss for each level, but time was really short. I am normally a programmer, so making all the sprites took quite some time. \r<br/>\r<br/>The soundtrack was made with autotracker, SFX with Bfxr, graphics with GraphicsGale Free, IDE was Sublime 2 + cmd.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you spot any bugs/crashes, feel free to email them to hegemege@gmail.com. To compile the game you need at least pygame and numpy. I used python 2.7 for compiling the .exe, other versions might not be supported\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, follow me on twitter! https://twitter.com/Hegemege\r<br/>\r<br/>--------------------------------------------\r<br/>KNOWN ISSUES\r<br/>*Mute doesnt work for sound effects\r<br/>*The game can be very hard at times(read: inevitable gameover), due to the random nature of powerups, \r<br/>*The Squid is underpowered\r<br/>*The sounds aren't well balanced.\r<br/>\r<br/>FUTURE ADDITIONS:\r<br/>*Level ending boss\r<br/>*better audio environment to match the blood vessel\r<br/>*Score\r<br/>*Slight tweaks in some sound effects\r<br/>*more to come...",
