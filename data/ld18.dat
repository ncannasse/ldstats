Now that the war is over, your job is infiltrate their combined base and then strike a blow for the people.\r<br/>\r<br/>How to play:  A simple infiltration game mixed with Robots-style play.  Stay out of the sight cones for the soldiers, unless you intend to lead them to their doom.  Red soldiers will attack blue.  Soldiers can be lead to mines or holes in order to dispatch them, or you can start a firefight between the two groups.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:  Arrow keys.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can pick up a health pack (red cross) in order to heal yourself.  Mines are small dots that will kill the enemy but not you.  (Mines will insta-kill anything, including tanks.)  Holes will kill you, or an enemy.\r<br/>\r<br/>Some extra buttons do work:\r<br/>\r<br/>R - Restart a level (in case FUBAR)\r<br/>K - Randomly kill an enemy (CHEATING!)\r<br/>F - FPS counter\r<br/>SPACEBAR - Skip dialogs (if one is onscreen)\r<br/>\r<br/>&quot;Music&quot; by Wolfram.\r<br/>\r<br/>Update: Here is my post-mortem for those interested: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2010/08/24/ludum-dare-18-entry-infiltrator-post-mortem/",

This shrapnel also kills the aliens and you can get a score multiplier for a cascade death by knocking out one of the large ships.\r<br/>\r<br/>Some bugs for sure and would certainly like to improve the collision detection as this has been implemented for time to code.

			"htmlDesc": "The aim of the game is to trick the enemy into killing themselves and each other using the Illusion based skills of the character.\r<br/>\r<br/>The first spell creates a decoy version of yourself. If the enemy sees this decoy it will think it's you and begin firing. The bullets will go straight through, hopefully killing any enemies on the opposite side.\r<br/>\r<br/>The second illusion tricks the enemy into thinking a pit (the black tiles) is a perfectly walkable tile. It will then either randomly wander into it, or walk across it while trying to chase you. Falling to his doom.\r<br/>\r<br/>The third illusion is an upgrade to the standard decoy. Any bullet hitting this decoy will bounce back towards the attacker.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, at any point you can turn yourself into a rock. If the enemy does not see you do this, it may just walk straight past you, giving you a chance to get out of harms way.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also. You have a hat. So do the enemy, but yours is better.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Controls\r<br/>- In-Game\r<br/>WASD movement\r<br/>Left-Click - Select/Cast illusions\r<br/>Right-Click - Cancel casting.\r<br/>Space - Don your awesome rock based disguise.\r<br/>\r<br/>- Menu\r<br/>WS - Cycle options\r<br/>Space - Select\r<br/>\r<br/>Requires the VC++ 2010 Redistrobutable.

			"htmlDesc": "Hello! Me and my friend Pete made this game below in 70ish hours, from scratch in Delphi.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>MARCH OF THE RORGERS - HOW TO PLAY\r<br/>==================================\r<br/>\r<br/>PREMISE\r<br/>-------\r<br/>Bobbing up and down at the top of the screen is the blue Orb. Defend it at all costs. It is surrounded by four laser towers which provide some limited defence. HOWEVER! Those towers alone are nowhere near powerful enough on their own to halt the march of the Rorgers. Instead, you will have to rely on the building abilities of the little crab-like Builder Bot sitting in your base. The key is to turn the enemies against each other. Here's how:\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>BUILD MENU\r<br/>----------\r<br/>\r<br/>Commands are executed mainly through the Build Menu, which is accessed by clicking anywhere on the terrain (except for the Orb). There are three types of command, and executing multiple commands in quick succession will cause the commands to be queued up.\r<br/>\r<br/>-SALVAGE-\r<br/>Your Builder Bot is capable of collecting resources from the land. Rocks and buildings can be salvaged by clicking on them in the terrain and selecting the 'GET' icon. Resources are important; without them there's only a limited amount that you can build. You can see how many you have in the top right corner of the screen. \r<br/>\r<br/>-SIGNS-\r<br/>Your bot is capable of building four types of signs pointing up, down, left and right. Each sign costs 10 resources and you may only build 3 signs per builder bot you have in your possession. Click where you would like to build and the build menu will appear. Select the sign you want from it, and your bot will go to work. \r<br/>\r<br/>A sign may not be placed directly near another sign; when the build menu is up you will see a red radius around locations where you cannot build.\r<br/>\r<br/>-DESTROY-\r<br/>Clicking on a sign and then the hammer icon will send your Builder Bot to destroy it, for when it is no longer useful or you need to free up sign slots.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>THE ORB\r<br/>-------\r<br/>\r<br/>The Orb that you are guarding is a special case, as clicking on it gives you the chance to build an extra Builder Bot. Having extra builders is good because it increases your sign limit and allows more commands to be executed simultaneously, but it comes at the relatively hefty price of 50 resources.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>THE RORGERS\r<br/>-----------\r<br/>There are 3 different types of Rorgers; Stress Rorgers (Red), Envy Rorgers (Green) and Fear Rorgers (Black). All have the common goal of destroying your Orb but different types of Rorgers do not get along. You must use this to your advantage by guiding them into conflict with each other via the signs you build. \r<br/>\r<br/>Rorgers begin at the bottom of the screen, emerging from their deployment tubes, and work their way upward before converging on your base.\r<br/>\r<br/>Signs will cause Rorgers to change direction when encountered, but they will not be fooled forever. After a while, unless they encounter another sign they will realise they have been led astray and head back towards your orb. \r<br/>\r<br/>IMPORTANT: Each Rorger will only be fooled by the same sign once, so don't expect the same trick to work twice.\r<br/>\r<br/>You can see on the right side of the screen a chart that indicates which type of Rorger will attack which. But be warned: this may change occasionally as a result of the volatile Rorger political situation that is beyond our comprehension. \r<br/>\r<br/>TIP: Be wary of those sneaky Fear Rorgers - they like to attack your base from the sides!\r<br/>\r<br/>---\r<br/>\r<br/>Good Luck, and we hope you enjoy the game!\r<br/>\r<br/>Love from,\r<br/>Surprised Man\r<br/>",

			"htmlDesc": "Update: Now works on all windows versions without compatibility mode hopefully. There was a problem with the PySFML 1.6 download for windows, compiled it from source and the game should work now.\r<br/>\r<br/>A puzzle game, featuring zombies. Don't let anybody escape to the safehouses. With two enemy types.\r<br/>\r<br/>Shambler: your basic human enemy, as soon as they can hear a zombie within 3 tiles of them they start to move towards the nearest safehouse. If they get there then you fail in your mission.\r<br/>\r<br/>Sniper: trained soldiers, although they can kill your zombies, you can get back at them, as years of sitting around waiting for something to happen have removed their ability to turn 180 degrees, so if you can get behind them then you can transform them easily and when they are on your side, you can use their rifle to kill far away enemies.\r<br/>\r<br/>The zombies in this game were caused by some mysterious magical force, they can resurrect the dead corpses of slain humans. A dead zombie however, remains dead.\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>*  left click on a zombie to select it\r<br/>*  right click on a tile to path towards it\r<br/>*  press the spacebar or end turn button to advance 1 turn\r<br/>*  as a sniper, right click on an enemy to shoot.\r<br/>*  press R to restart the level if you get stuck\r<br/>\r<br/>Only managed to finish making three levels in the end, but probably will add more in a post compo version. When you get past the third level you will just get a plain level with one enemy in the corner. There are level creation tools built in but they are not particularly well designed. Read below for info on how to use them.\r<br/>\r<br/>Really enjoyed this competition and hope to take part in future ludum dares.\r<br/>\r<br/>Here is how to create your own level:\r<br/>* Press E to enter the tile editor. Press one to use wall tiles and press zero to use floor tiles, click to paint\r<br/>* Press C to enter the collision editor, paint over the walls by clicking on them to make them colidable.\r<br/>* Press H to enter the entity placement editor, press 0 to place shamblers, 1 to place safehouses and 2 to place snipers. With shamblers and snipers, left click gets you a zombie and left click and shift gets you a sniper. After using the entity placement editor press R as this restarts the level and makes sure your entities will show up when you play.\r<br/>* Press P to play.\r<br/>* To save the level, press S.\r<br/>* If you need to skip forward to your level when you start up the game U skips forwards one level.",

Phew!\r<br/>\r<br/>Let me just say, I really only had 24 hours to work on this competition. For the entire first day I was learning Actionscript 3 and the Flixel library as I had never really used either before. I spent that time doing tutorials and such and really only began working on my game around 10pm Saturday, or 24 hours in. See the time lapse if you don't believe me! :P\r<br/>\r<br/>Anyway, I am entering my game in the competition, but to be fair I'm not sure it even qualifies as a game seeing as you cannot win. Or perhaps I am just sadistic, haha.\r<br/>\r<br/>What you will experience when you play the game is the beginning of an idea, and concept for the theme &quot;enemies as weapons.&quot; The idea is you are an alien parasite who controls humans, but they can only survive so long with you in their body. You will notice that the life counter turns red at different periods for different humans. This is because I wanted to implement a mechanic where humans would start to attack you once you showed signs of infection (once the number turns red). Well, really only the army guy would attack you.\r<br/>\r<br/>Also, I was going to make it so outside of a different pain tolerance (level when you start to show signs of infection), each human had a special ability. The army guy could shoot, medic could heal others (to help you reuse them easier), and the tech could use computers which would open doors. Combined I thought these mechanics plus some good level design would go together to make some pretty cool levels and an overall nifty idea.\r<br/>\r<br/>I definitely plan to further flesh out this idea after I rest from the weekend, and hope to have a much more polished and playable version available in the near future.\r<br/>\r<br/>A HUGE thanks to everyone from the Ludum Dare community, and also to the people in the #flixel channel on freenode. They were a big help while learning the library. I look forward to the next LD48 in 4 months.\r<br/>\r<br/>Take care,\r<br/>ItzMattu\r<br/>http://gdg.uml.edu",

			"htmlDesc": "This game was created for the 18th Ludum Dare 48 hour game competition. The theme was &quot;Enemies as Weapons&quot;. Development took 26 hours from August 20th-22nd, 2010.\r<br/>\r<br/>DESCRIPTION:\r<br/>You control a robot attempting to lure enemy seekers and spikes into mines before the mines explode. The difficulty ramps up as you destroy mines. You can build your chain multiplier for huge points. Chain resets when you take damage or let a mine explode. With each increase in difficulty there is a multiplier that will keep buffing your score.\r<br/>\r<br/>PROTIP:\r<br/>Send wall spikes into mines instead of using the seekers all the time--the base points are worth 5x as much!\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTE:\r<br/>AVOIDAL is a &quot;mouse skills&quot; type game so it was designed to be played with a mouse (or tablet perhaps.) It will be a lot harder to score well on a trackpad--sorry!\r<br/>\r<br/>TOOLS USED:\r<br/>Flash CS4 with ActionScript 3.0, Photoshop CS4, SFXR, Reason\r<br/>\r<br/>FEEDBACK:\r<br/>I really appreciate constructive feedback--especially about game balance and difficulty issues! I'll be using this feedback to release the post-compo final version. \r<br/>\r<br/>Thanks so much for your time playing my game!",

If the bullet hits a turret it will do damage to the turret.\r<br/>\r<br/>When you have your shield raises you receive no damage, but the shield is drained while in use, and regenerates slowly when unused. You raise your shield by holding the left mouse button.\r<br/>\r<br/>Once there is only one turret alive you release the megabomb and win the level.\r<br/>\r<br/>Hope you like it.\r<br/>",

Update now to my 1.1 so you can properly die*\r<br/>\r<br/>So this game's attempt to follow the theme was to use enemies as weapons by becoming an enemy yourself! So as Ace Disguise Master you defeat enemies and as you do you learn how to disguise as them. When disguised as an enemy you gain their abilities. By the way Ace is so elusive about his identity that he starts the game disguised as a yellow blorber thingy enemy. Can you get through the 6 stages alive? (probably because if you die you restart on the stage you died on. There also seems to be a strange invincibility bug I have yet to resolve)\r<br/>\r<br/>So the cards are supposed to be your health and what creature you will be next if you get killed. Since I did not get a human interface for all the monsters I made some will just give you a random creature instead\r<br/>\r<br/>Objective: Get to the yellow door alive! you start at the orange door\r<br/>\r<br/>Game Features:\r<br/>3 songs\r<br/>a bunch of sound effects.\r<br/>3 different creatures to become disguised as... (was supposed to be 7 didn't get time...)\r<br/>6 stages\r<br/>1 ending! Yes the game doesn't randomly exit out on you like my previous one when you beat it.\r<br/>options to turn off sound (You wouldn't want that right XD. Wait I made the music so maybe you do.)\r<br/>options to go full screen (Yes I do not force you into full screen at game start)\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls:\r<br/>up = jump\r<br/>left/right = move left and right. (Some times you have to be mid air to move XD )\r<br/>esc = exit game (sorry was going to make a menu... didn't have time. Well I guess that figures with 48 hours)\r<br/>\r<br/>Made with Game Maker, Logic Studios, snfx, and Corel\r<br/>(Wow too bad I don't have Photoshop anymore. Much easier to use than Corel... however I got trained on it first.)\r<br/>\r<br/>ok well all this typing is making me lazy and you may not be reading this at this point so go ahead and enjoy becoming strange monsters...",

This game requires Pixel shader model 2. You create skeletons using the bones of your enemies and use them to help you fight more enemies. The game was originally going to have the player collect pieces to become a lich but that is not implemented. The bones were also supposed to influence the skeleton's stats but that's also unimplemented.\r<br/>\r<br/>Be sure to follow the brown dirt paths since I didn't have time to code proper barriers and the enemies are only on the paths. There is currently no way to &quot;win&quot;.\r<br/>\r<br/>Instructions:\r<br/>The P key (P)ortals you between your sanctum and the outside\r<br/>The I key Brings up your (I)nventory\r<br/>\r<br/>Click the sarcophagus to bring up the skeleton maker. Click each bone and place it in the correctly labelled slot in the sarcophagus. There are tooltips to tell you what they are.

The only reason this game is Jam is because I ran out of time for the compo.\r<br/>\r<br/>I used C++ with Ogre, CEGUI, OIS, and my Framework with helper classes.\r<br/>\r<br/>Content was created using Blender, Photoshop, and PixPlant for the terrain textures.

Their rate of fire is slower, but their width provides greater cover while attached, and they take 2 shots to destroy once attached to you.\r<br/>Needle (thin) - as common as Cruisers, Needles are the fastest ship, both in movement speed and rate of fire. However, they also take only one hit to destroy, both when attached to your ship and when active. Because of their small side, they provide limited cover when attached.

In this game, the &quot;enemies&quot; are the falling blocks, which kill you if they fall on you, and you use them as a &quot;weapon&quot; to climb higher, and earn more points.\r<br/>More is explained in the in-game instructions.\r<br/>I know it's easy to change the highscore, but don't go around bragging if you do.\r<br/>\r<br/>All in all, i'm /REALLY/ happy with this, considering it's taken about 32h. I've got school in six hours, so i need to get some sleep. I might make a Jam entry with some nice ambient music off the interwebs tommorrow afternoon.\r<br/>\r<br/>But for now, have fun, enjoy, and GOODNIGHT!\r<br/>\r<br/>EDIT: I've added a timelapse. Also, about the sourcecode: the game was made in Game Maker 8, and i used some of the pro functions. to open it you'll need GM8, and to build it you'll need GM8Pro, or you will have to change those functions.\r<br/>\r<br/>I have now added a post-compo version above. Please give it a go :D\r<br/>New features:\r<br/>-Music :)\r<br/>-Replaced arrows with something slightly more obvious\r<br/>-Some Neat gfx\r<br/>-short invincibility after respawning\r<br/>-credits\r<br/>\r<br/>I haven't included source for the new version because of size, but if you want it give me a shout at info.clockworkgames (at) gmail.com",

You have no weapons or drilling equipment, and so must use your trusty tractor beam to defend yourself.  GO FOR THE KILL SCREEN!\r<br/>\r<br/>Arrow keys move, pressing and holding Z activates your tractor beam.  The beam is auto targeting and will grab the nearest enemy.  While the beam is on, it is locked at a specific length.\r<br/>\r<br/>Technical notes: This was made using the following libraries: Box2d, OpenGL, SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer.  It was compiled on a Mac using XCode for the Mac version, and compiled on a Mac using a mingw port of g++ for the Windows version.  I have included the original source and the updated source for the PC port.  The only difference is that I changed the c files specifically to cpp files (I was compiling them as such in the Xcode project but I didn't want the hassle when dealing with g++) and changed the mix channels to 2 (4 was causing a crash for some reason)).  I have included the Windows makefile but I don't even know where to get that mingw toolchain anymore, so I can't really provide support there, however, if you want to compile it for windows on a windows machine, I can probably help you get set up.  If you get the game compiling, and it doesn't work when you try to run it, remember it requires some game assets that are available in the game zip file.  Also remember it requires SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer, so you may need to install the runtime libraries or include them in the app file (Mac) or the project directory (Windows).\r<br/>\r<br/>(Dev notes: Procrastinated too much, especially considering that I decided mid-development to try implementing Box2d for the first time.  It was actually very easy to add and use but it cost me time.  I still like the game, and I hope you all do too, but I wish I had more enemy types.  And yes, the game has a kill screen, and crashes nicely if you reach it.  I haven't pulled it off yet because I get too greedy in the game and have too much fun spinning enemies around.)",

If you're having issues try making the window smaller and refreshing. If you're having severe framerate issues and are using Firefox, try switching to a WebKit-powered browser such as Chrome or Safari.]\r<br/>\r<br/>By default, all shots are attracted to you. Use this to your advantage by letting them orbit back into the enemies. Move around to gain repulsion energy, then hit 'a' to switch and send bullets flying. The scoring metric is the time taken to clear the screen.\r<br/>\r<br/>It's a difficult game. Take your time to get used to the mechanics, and try to have a store of repulsion energy for when you get surrounded. If you need precision, get a bullet to orbit and then switch to Repel when the shot lines up. For what it's worth, my high score hovers around 60s.\r<br/>\r<br/>Attract is written in pure JavaScript, using the HTML5 Canvas APIs. This was my first time using JavaScript for anything other than simple web design stuff, so it's highly un-optimised and probably not too clean. If things start to slow down, try closing a few tabs or resizing the browser window. As always, I doubt this will work with Internet Explorer.",

All enemies will be catchable and each will give the player habilities and disadvantages. An example is the ladybug that will explode as she touches the ground, sending the player flying a long distance, at cost of life. Other example is the electric eel, the alows a long ranged whip-like attack, but paralyzes the player form time to time.

Purple is super high health, red is about to die.  Your ship will auto recharge health but other parts wont, unless you have a healer attached.\r<br/>- Weapons are randomized but all have the same DPS so on average they will cause the same amount of damage. Larger bullets represent more damage.\r<br/>- Try to keep your ship balanced or it will become difficult to control.  Use engine placement to help balance things out.\r<br/>- Triangle - Weapon (random but normalized to the same DPS)\r<br/>- Square - Healer (auto repairs ship and attached parts)\r<br/>- Pentagon - Speed Booster (increases speed and turn rate)\r<br/>- Circle - Extender (allows for expansion)\r<br/>\r<br/>Controls\r<br/>\r<br/>- Left mouse - Move parts\r<br/>- Spacebar or Right mouse - Shoot\r<br/>- WASD - Move your ship\r<br/>- Alt+Enter - Go fullscreen (recommended)\r<br/>\r<br/>Tools Used\r<br/>- Visual C++ 2010 Express\r<br/>- Frank Engine (my open source game engine)\r<br/>- Box2d physics\r<br/>- SFXR and Audacity for sound effects\r<br/>- GIMP for image editing\r<br/>- Tortoise SVN for revision control",

Note that even though this is in the Jam, I was aiming for a Compo-compliant game, and as far as I can tell it is.\r<br/>\r<br/>The idea for this game was inspired by the old Short Circuit game, and something fiona said on IRC ... &quot;taking control of robots&quot;. It is common knowledge that all robots are evil and your enemies, so this amounts to using &quot;enemies as weapons&quot;. So there is you, robots, and terminals that you can use to take control of them. The idea was to use the robots to crash into each other, and also crash through walls to help you exit the level.\r<br/>\r<br/>In it's current state, pressing 'A' button (=Z key) while at a terminal will make a robot run in the direction that was last moving. One terminal is tied to one robot. You can crash two robots together and they die. Most testing was done zoomed out on the map so you could see everything, but for actually playing the game I think it's more fun if you can't see the whole map at one time. Problem still to be solved: controlling off-screen robots without things becoming confusing and frustrating (a radar HUD maybe ?).\r<br/>\r<br/>Timelapse for a chunk of the 48 hour part: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeChoj4nJQc\r<br/>\r<br/>Still needs: sound, proper sprite graphics, more than just test levels, robot waypoints, scoring and clearer goals etc. My mistake: trying to learn a new engine (Akihabara) during the compo+jam.

Thankfully, even though you are unarmed, you've got skillz in that you can hack most of the robots (except for the orange ones) given the SX3000 replacement circuit board. Hacking requires you sneak up behind a robot when he is not looking and touch him (make sure you have a circuit board and are standing on the ground - not in the air).  The goal: get out of the facility with your life intact.\r<br/>\r<br/>NOTES *) The preloader does not appear to be working so you\r<br/>         might have to wait a few seconds while staring at\r<br/>         what looks like an almost empty webpage.\r<br/>      0) In normal mode, Z = jump\r<br/>      1) Orange robots are NOT hackable!\r<br/>      2) You must NOT be in the air when you attempt to hack a robot or you WILL fail.\r<br/>      3) Hacks don't last forever, so get done with the bot quickly.\r<br/>      4) It is required that you hack certain bots to open certain security gates. TrackBot opens the Blue gates. WheelBot opens the Red gates.\r<br/>      5) In hacked mode: Z = jump  X = fire\r<br/>      6) Something I failed to get into the game instructions - the exit to each level looks kind of like an elevator door.\r<br/>      7) Stuck on a level with no way to finish it? No problem, just press 'Q' and the level will be reset ... but you will lose a life in the process.",

			"htmlDesc": "Retro-styled platformer/puzzle where the main character has the ability to temporarily control the enemy robots. Certain robots have abilities that can be put into use, other times controlling the 'bots is simply to get out of tight squeezes. Be careful when you decide to drop your mine and take over a 'bot because you're completely vulnerable while doing so.. other 'bots might come along and pick you off. Most of the level design was the last two hours, so it's a bit iffy. I'm curious if it's even possible to get through the eight levels. Click where you want to move to, closer the better. Double click to drop the mine in your current location, double click to remove it from anywhere. \r<br/>\r<br/>Apparently some people have experienced really slow animation. I cannot account for it, since it runs fine on my 7-year old XP box and my 5-yr old laptop. It won't ever run in Internet Explorer, you guys.. Okay, well, maybe IE9. \r<br/>\r<br/>Part of the plan for this game was to do something totally cross-platform with HTML/Javascript, and ideally this sort of thing will run on an iPad or N900. I have only tested it in Firefox, Chrome and Opera and it seems to run well. \r<br/>Developed in Linux with GIMP, Gedit, etc. Had to dust off my old WinXP box to run an ancient copy of Reason to do the music (the box of which I'll still need to try out everyone else's stuff!!) Still nothing comparable for Linux yet, but very close. Converted to MP3 &amp;&amp; Ogg with Audacity. \r<br/>\r<br/>You can download the &quot;Windows version&quot; and play it locally or just simply play it online through the web link. The &quot;source&quot; tarball doesn't include the audio files which makes for a much smaller file. Anyway, have fun. This be my first LD. -quoj@hoolikon.com ",

I had no way to see what the friggin' theme was, but I was tired anyway and had to be at work the next morning for another 12 hour shift.\r<br/>\r<br/>Saturday, August 21st, 2010\r<br/>Got home super late, still no internet. Luckily I checked the theme while at work, so I had an idea of what I wanted to do. But being this far behind was depressing... and knowing that I couldn't update my LD progress and participate with the rest of the community... or possibly even SUBMIT the game... I didn't have much enthusiasm. Plus I was super tired yet again and only worked on my idea for about an hour.\r<br/>\r<br/>Sunday, August 22nd, 2010\r<br/>THE FINAL DAY. STILL NO INTERNET.\r<br/>So I toiled away for about 4 hours and ended up with a little tech demo and nothing else. \r<br/>It's not a game, and I didn't even have time to implement enemies. Only the weapons that were ONCE enemies. This is like seeing the sequel before the prequel. It doesn't translate well.\r<br/>I still had a chance at the jam, though... so I decided to slap some SFX and music into the game very quickly... with an intent to cram some more programming in on Monday night.\r<br/>\r<br/>Monday, August 23rd, 2010\r<br/>HAD TO WORK LATE AGAIN. The internet was finally fixed when I got home, so I spent another hour or so catching up on the LD site and prepping my tech demo for an upload. Didn't have time to add anything new, so I didn't even bother.\r<br/>And there you have it... my LD 18 time line. OH JOYOUS JOY. I missed it all, and that sucks. I love seeing game previews on Friday and Saturday, then playing the end result on Sunday.

You cannot trap enemies by building walls around them, or hide from them by building walls around yourself.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you dare look at the source (quite horrible) you might notice that I actually started (most of Saturday) writing the game as a tower defense where you capture and reverse engineer enemies into towers!! But I got to a certain point where it semed more fun as it was, so I tweaked that into a game.\r<br/>\r<br/>The game was written in C#, in Visual Studio 2008 with the slimDX Direct3D wrapper used for D3D9 sprites. Windows Forms were used for the UI. Paint.NET was used for graphics.\r<br/>\r<br/>If you have problems running the game due to slimDX, please try installing manually from the msi file included in the slimDX folder.\r<br/>\r<br/>Please let me know of any bugs!!",

The rest is unnaffected/unchanged!\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>This is my first Ludum Dare. The game is 'finished' but untuned and there is no tutorial (see readme). No optimizations, no testing on other PC's. \r<br/>\r<br/>I spend too much time on the GUI part yesterday. I will polish this game later and put it on my website, because I like the idea of the game very much and want to polish it!\r<br/>\r<br/>;-)",
